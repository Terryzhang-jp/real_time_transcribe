The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.\nDoc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.\nDiagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly. But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.\nMermaid addresses this problem by enabling users to create easily modifiable diagrams, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).\nMermaid allows even non-programmers to easily create detailed and diagrams through the Mermaid Live Editor.\nTutorials has video tutorials.\nUse Mermaid with your favorite applications, check out the list of Community Integrations.\nFor a more detailed introduction to Mermaid and some of its more basic uses, look to the Beginner's Guide and Usage.\n🌐 CDN | 📖 Documentation | 🙌 Contribution | 🔌 Plug-Ins\n🖖 Keep a steady pulse: mermaid needs more Collaborators, Read More.\n🏆 Mermaid was nominated and won the JS Open Source Awards (2019) in the category \"The most exciting use of technology\"!!!\nThanks to all involved, people committing pull requests, people answering questions and special thanks to Tyler Long who is helping me maintain the project 🙏\nOur PR Visual Regression Testing is powered by Argos with their generous Open Source plan.

It would be great if we could form a core team of developers to cooperate with the future development of mermaid.\nAs part of this team you would get write access to the repository and would represent the project when answering questions and issues.\nTogether we could continue the work with things like:\nAdding more types of diagrams like mindmaps, ert diagrams, etc.\nImproving existing diagrams\nDon't hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved!\nContributors ​\nMermaid is a growing community and is always accepting new contributors. There's a lot of different ways to help out and we're always looking for extra hands! Look at this issue if you want to know where to start helping out.\nDetailed information about how to contribute can be found in the contribution guideline.\nRequirements ​\nvolta to manage node versions.\nNode.js. volta install node\npnpm package manager. volta install pnpm\nDevelopment Installation ​\nbash\ngit clone git@github.com:mermaid-js/mermaid.git cd mermaid # npx is required for first install as volta support for pnpm is not added yet. npx pnpm install pnpm test\nLint ​\nWe use eslint. We recommend you to install editor plugins to get real time lint result.\nTest ​\nManual test in browser: open dist/index.html\nRelease ​\nFor those who have the permission to do so:\nUpdate version number in package.json.\nThe above command generates files into the dist folder and publishes them to npmjs.com.\nSecurity and safe diagrams ​\nFor public sites, it can be precarious to retrieve text from users on the internet, storing that content for presentation in a browser at a later stage. The reason is that the user content can contain embedded malicious scripts that will run when the data is presented. For Mermaid this is a risk, specially as mermaid diagrams contain many characters that are used in html which makes the standard sanitation unusable as it also breaks the diagrams. We still make an effort to sanitize the incoming code and keep refining the process but it is hard to guarantee that there are no loop holes.\nAs an extra level of security for sites with external users we are happy to introduce a new security level in which the diagram is rendered in a sandboxed iframe preventing JavaScript in the code from being executed. This is a great step forward for better security.\nUnfortunately you can not have a cake and eat it at the same time which in this case means that some of the interactive functionality gets blocked along with the possible malicious code.\nReporting vulnerabilities ​\nTo report a vulnerability, please e-mail security@mermaid.live with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.\nAppreciation ​\nA quick note from Knut Sveidqvist:\nMany thanks to the d3 and dagre-d3 projects for providing the graphical layout and drawing libraries!\nThanks also to the js-sequence-diagram project for usage of the grammar for the sequence diagrams. Thanks to Jessica Peter for inspiration and starting point for gantt rendering.\nThank you to Tyler Long who has been a collaborator since April 2017.\nThank you to the ever-growing list of contributors that brought the project this far!\nMermaid was created by Knut Sveidqvist for easier documentation.",

Using the Mermaid Live Editor ​\nAvailable at the Mermaid Live Editor website.\nFeatures ​\n\n• Diagram Code ​\nIn the Code panel, write or edit Mermaid code, and instantly Preview the rendered result in the diagram panel.\nHere is an example of Mermaid code and its rendered result:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngraph TD A[Enter Chart Definition] --> B(Preview) B --> C{decide} C --> D[Keep] C --> E[Edit Definition] E --> B D --> F[Save Image and Code] F --> B \nCtrl + Enter|\n\n• Configurations ​\nConfiguration options are available in the Configuration panel. The options are applied to the diagram in the Preview panel.\nTo learn more, visit the Configuration Reference page\n\n• Editing History ​\nYour code will be autosaved and appear in the Timeline tab of the History section. Edits are saved every minute and only the last 30 edits are viewable.\nAlternatively, you can manually save code by clicking on the Save icon from the History section.\nINFO\nHistory is stored in the browser storage only.\n\n• Saving a diagram ​\nThere are multiple ways of saving your diagram from the Actions section:\nexport PNG\nexport SVG\nexport as Markdown\n\n• Editing your diagrams ​\nTo edit your diagram, you can copy paste existing Mermaid diagram code into the Code section of the Live Editor.\nOr:\ncreate a new diagram from scratch\nuse a Sample Diagram from the Sample Diagrams section\n\n• Loading from Gists ​\nThe Gist you create should have a code.mmd file and optionally a config.json, similar to this example.\nINFO\nTo learn about Gists, visit the GitHub documentation page on Creating gists.\nOnce you have created a Gist, copy paste the Gist URL into the respective field in the Actions section and click on the Load Gist button.\nHere is an example of a Gist being loaded into the Editor:\nhttps://mermaid.live/edit?gist=https://gist.github.com/sidharthv96/6268a23e673a533dcb198f241fd7012a\nAnd, here is the diagram view from the above example:\nhttps://mermaid.live/view?gist=https://gist.github.com/sidharthv96/6268a23e673a533dcb198f241fd7012a\n2. Using the Mermaid Chart Editor ​\nAvailable at the Mermaid Chart website.\nMermaid Chart is a web-based diagram editor that allows you to create and edit diagrams in your browser. It is built by the team behind Mermaid.\nFeatures include:\nAI diagramming\nCollaboration & multi-user editing\nStorage\nand more\nTo learn more, visit the Mermaid Chart page in the Ecosystem section of the documentation.\nOr go to the Mermaid Chart website to sign up for a Free account.\n3. Using Mermaid Plugins ​\nMermaid Plugins ​\nYou can generate Mermaid diagrams from within popular applications using plug-ins.\nFor a list of Mermaid Plugins and Integrations, visit the Integrations page.\nMermaid Chart Plugins ​\nMermaid Chart plugins are available for:\nChatGPT\nJetBrains IDE\nMicrosoft PowerPoint\nMicrosoft Word\nVisual Studio Code\nTo learn more, visit the Mermaid Chart Plugins page.\nNative Mermaid Support ​\nFor apps that support markdown (e.g. GitHub and GitLab), you can add Mermaid diagrams by making a mermaid code block.\nmarkdown\nThe following code-block will be rendered as a Mermaid diagram: ```mermaid flowchart LR A --> B ```\n4. Calling the Mermaid JavaScript API ​\nThis method can be used with any common web server like Apache, IIS, Nginx, and Node Express.\nYou will also need a text editing tool like Notepad++ to generate an html file. It is then deployed by a web browser, i.e. Firefox, Chrome, Safari.\nINFO\nInternet Explorer is not supported.\nThe API works by pulling rendering instructions from the source mermaid.js in order to render diagrams on the page.\nRequirements for the Mermaid API ​\nWhen writing the html file, we give two instructions inside the html code to the web browser:\na. The Mermaid code for the diagram we want to create.\nb. The importing of the Mermaid library through the mermaid.esm.mjs or mermaid.esm.min.mjs, and the mermaid.initialize() call, which dictates the appearance of diagrams and also starts the rendering process.\nExamples ​\nThis is an example of an embedded Mermaid diagram definition inside a <pre class=\"mermaid\">:\nhtml\n<body> Here is a mermaid diagram: <pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph TD A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer] B --> C[Server01] B --> D[Server02] </pre> </body>\nINFO\nEvery Mermaid chart/graph/diagram definition should have separate <pre> tags.\nThis is an example of a Mermaid import and the mermaid.initialize() call.\nINFO\nA mermaid.initialize() call takes all the definitions contained within <pre class=\"mermaid\"> tags and renders them into diagrams.\nhtml\n<body> <script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true }); </script> </body>\nINFO\nRendering in Mermaid is initialized by the mermaid.initialize() call. However, doing the opposite lets you control when it starts looking for <pre> tags inside the web page with mermaid.initialize(). This is useful when you think that not all <pre> tags may have loaded on the execution of mermaid.esm.min.mjs file.\nstartOnLoad is one of the parameters that can be defined by mermaid.initialize()\nParameterDescriptionTypeValues\nstartOnLoad\tToggle for Rendering upon loading\tBoolean\ttrue, false\t\nIn this example, the mermaidAPI is being called through the CDN:\nhtml\n<html> <body> Here is one mermaid diagram: <pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph TD A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer] B --> C[Server1] B --> D[Server2] </pre> And here is another: <pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph TD A[Client] -->|tcp_123| B B(Load Balancer) B -->|tcp_456| C[Server1] B -->|tcp_456| D[Server2] </pre> <script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true }); </script> </body> </html>\nIn this example, mermaid.js is referenced in src as a separate JavaScript file:\nhtml\n<html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> </head> <body> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph LR A --- B B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner); </pre> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph TD A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer] B --> C[Server1] B --> D[Server2] </pre> <script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'The/Path/In/Your/Package/mermaid.esm.mjs'; mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true }); </script> </body> </html>\n5. Adding Mermaid as a dependency ​\nBelow are the steps for adding Mermaid as a dependency:\nInstall node v16\nINFO\nTo learn more about downloading and installing Node.js and npm, visit the npm Docs website.\nInstall yarn using npm with this command:\nnpm install -g yarn\nAfter yarn installs, enter this command:\nyarn add mermaid\nTo add Mermaid as a dev dependency, enter this command:\nyarn add --dev mermaid\nClosing note ​\nINFO\nComments from Knut Sveidqvist, creator of Mermaid:\nIn early versions of Mermaid, the <script> tag was invoked in the <head> part of the web page. Nowadays, we can place it in the <body> as seen above. Older parts of the documentation frequently reflect the previous way, which still works.",

    "page_content": "Diagram Syntax | Mermaid\nMermaid's syntax is used to create diagrams. You'll find that it is not too tricky and can be learned in a day. The next sections dive deep into the syntax of each diagram type.\nSyntax, together with Deployment and Configuration constitute the whole of Mermaid.\nDiagram Examples can be found in the Mermaid Live Editor, it is also a great practice area.\nSyntax Structure ​\nOne would notice that all Diagrams definitions begin with a declaration of the diagram type, followed by the definitions of the diagram and its contents. This declaration notifies the parser which kind of diagram the code is supposed to generate.\nExample : The code below is for an Entity Relationship Diagram, specified by the erDiagram declaration. What follows is the definition of the different Entities represented in it.\nCode:\nmermaid\nerDiagram CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : has CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places CUSTOMER ||--o{ INVOICE : \"liable for\" DELIVERY-ADDRESS ||--o{ ORDER : receives INVOICE ||--|{ ORDER : covers ORDER ||--|{ ORDER-ITEM : includes PRODUCT-CATEGORY ||--|{ PRODUCT : contains PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER-ITEM : \"ordered in\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nThe Getting Started section can also provide some practical examples of mermaid syntax.\nDiagram Breaking ​\nOne should beware the use of some words or symbols that can break diagrams. These words or symbols are few and often only affect specific types of diagrams. The table below will continuously be updated.\nDiagram BreakersReasonSolution\nComments\t\t\t\n%%{``}%%\tSimilar to Directives confuses the renderer.\tIn comments using %%, avoid using \"{}\".\t\nFlow-Charts\t\t\t\n'end'\tThe word \"End\" can cause Flowcharts and Sequence diagrams to break\tWrap them in quotation marks to prevent breakage.\t\nNodes inside Nodes\tMermaid gets confused with nested shapes\twrap them in quotation marks to prevent breaking\t\nMermaid Live Editor ​\nNow, that you've seen what you should not add to your diagrams, you can play around with them in the Mermaid Live Editor.\nConfiguration ​\nConfiguration is the third part of Mermaid, after deployment and syntax. It deals with the different ways that Mermaid can be customized across different deployments.\nIf you are interested in altering and customizing your Mermaid Diagrams, you will find the methods and values available for Configuration here. It includes themes. This section will introduce the different methods of configuring the behaviors and appearances of Mermaid Diagrams. The following are the most commonly used methods, and they are all tied to Mermaid Deployment methods.\nConfiguration Section in the Live Editor. ​\nHere you can edit certain values to change the behavior and appearance of the diagram.\nThe initialize() call ​\nUsed when Mermaid is called via an API, or through a <script> tag.\nDirectives ​\nAllows for the limited reconfiguration of a diagram just before it is rendered. It can alter the font style, color and other aesthetic aspects of the diagram. You can pass a directive alongside your definition inside %%{ }%%. It can be done either above or below your diagram definition.\nTheme Manipulation ​\nAn application of using Directives to change Themes. Theme is a value within Mermaid's configuration that dictates the color scheme for diagrams.\nLayout and look ​\nWe've restructured how Mermaid renders diagrams, enabling new features like selecting layout and look. Currently, this is supported for flowcharts and state diagrams, with plans to extend support to all diagram types.\nSelecting Diagram Looks ​\nMermaid offers a variety of styles or “looks” for your diagrams, allowing you to tailor the visual appearance to match your specific needs or preferences. Whether you prefer a hand-drawn or classic style, you can easily customize your diagrams.\nAvailable Looks:\n• Hand-Drawn Look: For a more personal, creative touch, the hand-drawn look brings a sketch-like quality to your diagrams. This style is perfect for informal settings or when you want to add a bit of personality to your diagrams. • Classic Look: If you prefer the traditional Mermaid style, the classic look maintains the original appearance that many users are familiar with. It’s great for consistency across projects or when you want to keep the familiar aesthetic.\nHow to Select a Look:\nYou can select a look by adding the look parameter in the metadata section of your Mermaid diagram code. Here’s an example:\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- config: look: handDrawn theme: neutral --- flowchart LR A[Start] --> B{Decision} B -->|Yes| C[Continue] B -->|No| D[Stop] \nCtrl + Enter|\nSelecting Layout Algorithms ​\nIn addition to customizing the look of your diagrams, Mermaid Chart now allows you to choose different layout algorithms to better organize and present your diagrams, especially when dealing with more complex structures. The layout algorithm dictates how nodes and edges are arranged on the page.\nSupported Layout Algorithms: ​\n• Dagre (default): This is the classic layout algorithm that has been used in Mermaid for a long time. It provides a good balance of simplicity and visual clarity, making it ideal for most diagrams. • ELK: For those who need more sophisticated layout capabilities, especially when working with large or intricate diagrams, the ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel) layout offers advanced options. It provides a more optimized arrangement, potentially reducing overlapping and improving readability. This is not included out the box but needs to be added when integrating mermaid for sites/applications that want to have elk support.\nHow to Select a Layout Algorithm: ​\nYou can specify the layout algorithm directly in the metadata section of your Mermaid diagram code. Here’s an example:\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- config: layout: elk look: handDrawn theme: dark --- flowchart TB A[Start] --> B{Decision} B -->|Yes| C[Continue] B -->|No| D[Stop] \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, the layout: elk line configures the diagram to use the ELK layout algorithm, along with the hand drawn look and forest theme.\nCustomizing ELK Layout: ​\nWhen using the ELK layout, you can further refine the diagram’s configuration, such as how nodes are placed and whether parallel edges should be combined:\nTo combine parallel edges, use mergeEdges: true | false.\nTo configure node placement, use nodePlacementStrategy with the following options: \nSIMPLE\nNETWORK_SIMPLEX\nLINEAR_SEGMENTS\nBRANDES_KOEPF (default)\nExample configuration:\n--- config: layout: elk elk: mergeEdges: true nodePlacementStrategy: LINEAR_SEGMENTS --- flowchart LR A[Start] --> B{Choose Path} B -->|Option 1| C[Path 1] B -->|Option 2| D[Path 2] #### Using Dagre Layout with Classic Look:\nAnother example:\n--- config: layout: dagre look: classic theme: default --- flowchart LR A[Start] --> B{Choose Path} B -->|Option 1| C[Path 1] B -->|Option 2| D[Path 2]\nThese options give you the flexibility to create diagrams that not only look great but are also arranged to best suit your data’s structure and flow.\nWhen integrating Mermaid, you can include look and layout configuration with the initialize call. This is also where you add the loading of elk.",

    "page_content": "Sequence diagrams | Mermaid\nA Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams.\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? John-->>Alice: Great! Alice-)John: See you later! \nCtrl + Enter|\nINFO\nA note on nodes, the word \"end\" could potentially break the diagram, due to the way that the mermaid language is scripted.\nIf unavoidable, one must use parentheses(), quotation marks \"\", or brackets {},[], to enclose the word \"end\". i.e : (end), [end], {end}.\nSyntax ​\nParticipants ​\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are rendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a different order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of appearance by doing the following:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram participant Alice participant Bob Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob \nCtrl + Enter|\nActors ​\nIf you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram actor Alice actor Bob Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice \nCtrl + Enter|\nAliases ​\nThe actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram participant A as Alice participant J as John A->>J: Hello John, how are you? J->>A: Great! \nCtrl + Enter|\nActor Creation and Destruction (v10.3.0+) ​\nIt is possible to create and destroy actors by messages. To do so, add a create or destroy directive before the message.\ncreate participant B A --> B: Hello\nCreate directives support actor/participant distinction and aliases. The sender or the recipient of a message can be destroyed but only the recipient can be created.\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you ? Bob->>Alice: Fine, thank you. And you? create participant Carl Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl! create actor D as Donald Carl->>D: Hi! destroy Carl Alice-xCarl: We are too many destroy Bob Bob->>Alice: I agree \nCtrl + Enter|\nUnfixable actor/participant creation/deletion error ​\nIf an error of the following type occurs when creating or deleting an actor/participant:\nThe destroyed participant participant-name does not have an associated destroying message after its declaration. Please check the sequence diagram.\nAnd fixing diagram code does not get rid of this error and rendering of all other diagrams results in the same error, then you need to update the mermaid version to (v10.7.0+).\nGrouping / Box ​\nThe actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:\nbox Aqua Group Description ... actors ... end box Group without description ... actors ... end box rgb(33,66,99) ... actors ... end box rgba(33,66,99,0.5) ... actors ... end\nINFO\nIf your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:\nbox transparent Aqua ... actors ... end\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram box Purple Alice & John participant A participant J end box Another Group participant B participant C end A->>J: Hello John, how are you? J->>A: Great! A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charley? B->>C: Hello Charley, how are you? \nCtrl + Enter|\nMessages ​\nMessages can be of two displayed either solid or with a dotted line.\n[Actor][Arrow][Actor]:Message text\nThere are ten types of arrows currently supported:\nTypeDescription\n->\tSolid line without arrow\t\n-->\tDotted line without arrow\t\n->>\tSolid line with arrowhead\t\n-->>\tDotted line with arrowhead\t\n<<->>\tSolid line with bidirectional arrowheads (v11.0.0+)\t\n<<-->>\tDotted line with bidirectional arrowheads (v11.0.0+)\t\n-x\tSolid line with a cross at the end\t\n--x\tDotted line with a cross at the end.\t\n-)\tSolid line with an open arrow at the end (async)\t\n--)\tDotted line with a open arrow at the end (async)\t\nActivations ​\nIt is possible to activate and deactivate an actor. (de)activation can be dedicated declarations:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? activate John John-->>Alice: Great! deactivate John \nCtrl + Enter|\nThere is also a shortcut notation by appending +/- suffix to the message arrow:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you? John-->>-Alice: Great! \nCtrl + Enter|\nActivations can be stacked for same actor:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you? Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me? John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you! John-->>-Alice: I feel great! \nCtrl + Enter|\nNotes ​\nIt is possible to add notes to a sequence diagram. This is done by the notation Note [ right of | left of | over ] [Actor]: Text in note content\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram participant John Note right of John: Text in note \nCtrl + Enter|\nIt is also possible to create notes spanning two participants:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->John: Hello John, how are you? Note over Alice,John: A typical interaction \nCtrl + Enter|\nLine breaks ​\nLine break can be added to Note and Message:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->John: Hello John,<br/>how are you? Note over Alice,John: A typical interaction<br/>But now in two lines \nCtrl + Enter|\nLine breaks in Actor names requires aliases:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram participant Alice as Alice<br/>Johnson Alice->John: Hello John,<br/>how are you? Note over Alice,John: A typical interaction<br/>But now in two lines \nCtrl + Enter|\nLoops ​\nIt is possible to express loops in a sequence diagram. This is done by the notation\nloop Loop text ... statements ... end\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->John: Hello John, how are you? loop Every minute John-->Alice: Great! end \nCtrl + Enter|\nAlt ​\nIt is possible to express alternative paths in a sequence diagram. This is done by the notation\nalt Describing text ... statements ... else ... statements ... end\nor if there is sequence that is optional (if without else).\nopt Describing text ... statements ... end\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? alt is sick Bob->>Alice: Not so good :( else is well Bob->>Alice: Feeling fresh like a daisy end opt Extra response Bob->>Alice: Thanks for asking end \nCtrl + Enter|\nParallel ​\nIt is possible to show actions that are happening in parallel.\nThis is done by the notation\npar [Action 1] ... statements ... and [Action 2] ... statements ... and [Action N] ... statements ... end\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram par Alice to Bob Alice->>Bob: Hello guys! and Alice to John Alice->>John: Hello guys! end Bob-->>Alice: Hi Alice! John-->>Alice: Hi Alice! \nCtrl + Enter|\nIt is also possible to nest parallel blocks.\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram par Alice to Bob Alice->>Bob: Go help John and Alice to John Alice->>John: I want this done today par John to Charlie John->>Charlie: Can we do this today? and John to Diana John->>Diana: Can you help us today? end end \nCtrl + Enter|\nCritical Region ​\nIt is possible to show actions that must happen automatically with conditional handling of circumstances.\nThis is done by the notation\ncritical [Action that must be performed] ... statements ... option [Circumstance A] ... statements ... option [Circumstance B] ... statements ... end\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram critical Establish a connection to the DB Service-->DB: connect option Network timeout Service-->Service: Log error option Credentials rejected Service-->Service: Log different error end \nCtrl + Enter|\nIt is also possible to have no options at all\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram critical Establish a connection to the DB Service-->DB: connect end \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis critical block can also be nested, equivalently to the par statement as seen above.\nBreak ​\nIt is possible to indicate a stop of the sequence within the flow (usually used to model exceptions).\nThis is done by the notation\nbreak [something happened] ... statements ... end\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Consumer-->API: Book something API-->BookingService: Start booking process break when the booking process fails API-->Consumer: show failure end API-->BillingService: Start billing process \nCtrl + Enter|\nBackground Highlighting ​\nIt is possible to highlight flows by providing colored background rects. This is done by the notation\nrect COLOR ... content ... end\nThe colors are defined using rgb and rgba syntax.\nrect rgb(0, 255, 0) ... content ... end\nrect rgba(0, 0, 255, .1) ... content ... end\nSee the examples below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram participant Alice participant John rect rgb(191, 223, 255) note right of Alice: Alice calls John. Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you? rect rgb(200, 150, 255) Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me? John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you! end John-->>-Alice: I feel great! end Alice ->>+ John: Did you want to go to the game tonight? John -->>- Alice: Yeah! See you there. \nCtrl + Enter|\nComments can be entered within a sequence diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? %% this is a comment John-->>Alice: Great! \nCtrl + Enter|\nEntity codes to escape characters ​\nIt is possible to escape characters using the syntax exemplified here.\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram A->>B: I #9829; you! B->>A: I #9829; you #infin; times more! \nCtrl + Enter|\nNumbers given are base 10, so # can be encoded as #35;. It is also supported to use HTML character names.\nBecause semicolons can be used instead of line breaks to define the markup, you need to use #59; to include a semicolon in message text.\nsequenceNumbers ​\nIt is possible to get a sequence number attached to each arrow in a sequence diagram. This can be configured when adding mermaid to the website as shown below:\nhtml\n<script> mermaid.initialize({ sequence: { showSequenceNumbers: true } }); </script>\nIt can also be turned on via the diagram code as in the diagram:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram autonumber Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? loop HealthCheck John->>John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts! John-->>Alice: Great! John->>Bob: How about you? Bob-->>John: Jolly good! \nCtrl + Enter|\nActor Menus ​\nActors can have popup-menus containing individualized links to external pages. For example, if an actor represented a web service, useful links might include a link to the service health dashboard, repo containing the code for the service, or a wiki page describing the service.\nThis can be configured by adding one or more link lines with the format:\nlink <actor>: <link-label> @ <link-url>\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram participant Alice participant John link Alice: Dashboard @ https://dashboard.contoso.com/alice link Alice: Wiki @ https://wiki.contoso.com/alice link John: Dashboard @ https://dashboard.contoso.com/john link John: Wiki @ https://wiki.contoso.com/john Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? John-->>Alice: Great! Alice-)John: See you later! \nCtrl + Enter|\nAdvanced Menu Syntax ​\nThere is an advanced syntax that relies on JSON formatting. If you are comfortable with JSON format, then this exists as well.\nThis can be configured by adding the links lines with the format:\nlinks <actor>: <json-formatted link-name link-url pairs>\nAn example is below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram participant Alice participant John links Alice: {\"Dashboard\": \"https://dashboard.contoso.com/alice\", \"Wiki\": \"https://wiki.contoso.com/alice\"} links John: {\"Dashboard\": \"https://dashboard.contoso.com/john\", \"Wiki\": \"https://wiki.contoso.com/john\"} Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? John-->>Alice: Great! Alice-)John: See you later! \nCtrl + Enter|\nStyling ​\nStyling of a sequence diagram is done by defining a number of css classes. During rendering these classes are extracted from the file located at src/themes/sequence.scss\nClasses used ​\nClassDescription\nactor\tStyles for the actor box.\t\nactor-top\tStyles for the actor figure/ box at the top of the diagram.\t\nactor-bottom\tStyles for the actor figure/ box at the bottom of the diagram.\t\ntext.actor\tStyles for text of all of the actors.\t\ntext.actor-box\tStyles for text of the actor box.\t\ntext.actor-man\tStyles for text of the actor figure.\t\nactor-line\tThe vertical line for an actor.\t\nmessageLine0\tStyles for the solid message line.\t\nmessageLine1\tStyles for the dotted message line.\t\nmessageText\tDefines styles for the text on the message arrows.\t\nlabelBox\tDefines styles label to left in a loop.\t\nlabelText\tStyles for the text in label for loops.\t\nloopText\tStyles for the text in the loop box.\t\nloopLine\tDefines styles for the lines in the loop box.\t\nnote\tStyles for the note box.\t\nnoteText\tStyles for the text on in the note boxes.\t\nSample stylesheet ​\ncss\nbody { background: white; } .actor { stroke: #ccccff; fill: #ececff; } text.actor { fill: black; stroke: none; font-family: Helvetica; } .actor-line { stroke: grey; } .messageLine0 { stroke-width: 1.5; stroke-dasharray: '2 2'; marker-end: 'url(#arrowhead)'; stroke: black; } .messageLine1 { stroke-width: 1.5; stroke-dasharray: '2 2'; stroke: black; } #arrowhead { fill: black; } .messageText { fill: black; stroke: none; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', verdana, arial; font-size: 14px; } .labelBox { stroke: #ccccff; fill: #ececff; } .labelText { fill: black; stroke: none; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', verdana, arial; } .loopText { fill: black; stroke: none; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', verdana, arial; } .loopLine { stroke-width: 2; stroke-dasharray: '2 2'; marker-end: 'url(#arrowhead)'; stroke: #ccccff; } .note { stroke: #decc93; fill: #fff5ad; } .noteText { fill: black; stroke: none; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', verdana, arial; font-size: 14px; }\nConfiguration ​\nIt is possible to adjust the margins for rendering the sequence diagram.\nThis is done by defining mermaid.sequenceConfig or by the CLI to use a json file with the configuration.

    "page_content": "Class diagrams | Mermaid\n\"In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.\"\n-Wikipedia\nThe class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling to translate the models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modeling. The classes in a class diagram represent both the main elements, interactions in the application, and the classes to be programmed.\nMermaid can render class diagrams.\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- title: Animal example --- classDiagram note \"From Duck till Zebra\" Animal <|-- Duck note for Duck \"can fly\\ncan swim\\ncan dive\\ncan help in debugging\" Animal <|-- Fish Animal <|-- Zebra Animal : +int age Animal : +String gender Animal: +isMammal() Animal: +mate() class Duck{ +String beakColor +swim() +quack() } class Fish{ -int sizeInFeet -canEat() } class Zebra{ +bool is_wild +run() } \nCtrl + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nClass ​\nUML provides mechanisms to represent class members, such as attributes and methods, and additional information about them. A single instance of a class in the diagram contains three compartments:\nThe top compartment contains the name of the class. It is printed in bold and centered, and the first letter is capitalized. It may also contain optional annotation text describing the nature of the class.\nThe middle compartment contains the attributes of the class. They are left-aligned and the first letter is lowercase.\nThe bottom compartment contains the operations the class can execute. They are also left-aligned and the first letter is lowercase.\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- title: Bank example --- classDiagram class BankAccount BankAccount : +String owner BankAccount : +Bigdecimal balance BankAccount : +deposit(amount) BankAccount : +withdrawal(amount) \nCtrl + Enter|\nDefine a class ​\nThere are two ways to define a class:\nExplicitly using keyword class like class Animal which would define the Animal class.\nVia a relationship which defines two classes at a time along with their relationship. For instance, Vehicle <|-- Car.\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Animal Vehicle <|-- Car \nCtrl + Enter|\nNaming convention: a class name should be composed only of alphanumeric characters (including unicode), underscores, and dashes (-).\nClass labels ​\nIn case you need to provide a label for a class, you can use the following syntax:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Animal[\"Animal with a label\"] class Car[\"Car with *! symbols\"] Animal --> Car \nCtrl + Enter|\nYou can also use backticks to escape special characters in the label:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class `Animal Class!` class `Car Class` `Animal Class!` --> `Car Class` \nCtrl + Enter|\nDefining Members of a class ​\nUML provides mechanisms to represent class members such as attributes and methods, as well as additional information about them.\nMermaid distinguishes between attributes and functions/methods based on if the parenthesis () are present or not. The ones with () are treated as functions/methods, and all others as attributes.\nThere are two ways to define the members of a class, and regardless of whichever syntax is used to define the members, the output will still be same. The two different ways are :\nAssociate a member of a class using : (colon) followed by member name, useful to define one member at a time. For example:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class BankAccount BankAccount : +String owner BankAccount : +BigDecimal balance BankAccount : +deposit(amount) BankAccount : +withdrawal(amount) \nCtrl + Enter|\nAssociate members of a class using {} brackets, where members are grouped within curly brackets. Suitable for defining multiple members at once. For example:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class BankAccount{ +String owner +BigDecimal balance +deposit(amount) +withdrawal(amount) } \nCtrl + Enter|\nReturn Type ​\nOptionally you can end a method/function definition with the data type that will be returned (note: there must be a space between the final ) and the return type). An example:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class BankAccount{ +String owner +BigDecimal balance +deposit(amount) bool +withdrawal(amount) int } \nCtrl + Enter|\nGeneric Types ​\nGenerics can be represented as part of a class definition, and for class members/return types. In order to denote an item as generic, you enclose that type within ~ (tilde). Nested type declarations such as List<List<int>> are supported, though generics that include a comma are currently not supported. (such as List<List<K, V>>)\nnote when a generic is used within a class definition, the generic type is NOT considered part of the class name. i.e.: for any syntax which required you to reference the class name, you need to drop the type part of the definition. This also means that mermaid does not currently support having two classes with the same name, but different generic types.\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Square~Shape~{ int id List~int~ position setPoints(List~int~ points) getPoints() List~int~ } Square : -List~string~ messages Square : +setMessages(List~string~ messages) Square : +getMessages() List~string~ Square : +getDistanceMatrix() List~List~int~~ \nCtrl + Enter|\nVisibility ​\nTo describe the visibility (or encapsulation) of an attribute or method/function that is a part of a class (i.e. a class member), optional notation may be placed before that members' name:\n+ Public\n- Private\n# Protected\n~ Package/Internal\nnote you can also include additional classifiers to a method definition by adding the following notation to the end of the method, i.e.: after the () or after the return type:\n* Abstract e.g.: someAbstractMethod()* or someAbstractMethod() int*\n$ Static e.g.: someStaticMethod()$ or someStaticMethod() String$\nnote you can also include additional classifiers to a field definition by adding the following notation to the very end:\n$ Static e.g.: String someField$\nDefining Relationship ​\nA relationship is a general term covering the specific types of logical connections found on class and object diagrams.\nThere are eight different types of relations defined for classes under UML which are currently supported:\nTypeDescription\n<|--\tInheritance\t\n*--\tComposition\t\no--\tAggregation\t\n-->\tAssociation\t\n--\tLink (Solid)\t\n..>\tDependency\t\n..|>\tRealization\t\n..\tLink (Dashed)\t\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram classA <|-- classB classC *-- classD classE o-- classF classG <-- classH classI -- classJ classK <.. classL classM <|.. classN classO .. classP \nCtrl + Enter|\nWe can use the labels to describe the nature of the relation between two classes. Also, arrowheads can be used in the opposite direction as well:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram classA --|> classB : Inheritance classC --* classD : Composition classE --o classF : Aggregation classG --> classH : Association classI -- classJ : Link(Solid) classK ..> classL : Dependency classM ..|> classN : Realization classO .. classP : Link(Dashed) \nCtrl + Enter|\nLabels on Relations ​\nIt is possible to add label text to a relation:\n[classA][Arrow][ClassB]:LabelText\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram classA <|-- classB : implements classC *-- classD : composition classE o-- classF : aggregation \nCtrl + Enter|\nTwo-way relations ​\nRelations can logically represent an N:M association:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram Animal <|--|> Zebra \nCtrl + Enter|\nHere is the syntax:\n[Relation Type][Link][Relation Type]\nWhere Relation Type can be one of:\nTypeDescription\n<|\tInheritance\t\n\\*\tComposition\t\no\tAggregation\t\n>\tAssociation\t\n<\tAssociation\t\n|>\tRealization\t\nAnd Link can be one of:\nTypeDescription\n--\tSolid\t\n..\tDashed\t\nDefine Namespace ​\nA namespace groups classes.\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram namespace BaseShapes { class Triangle class Rectangle { double width double height } } \nCtrl + Enter|\nCardinality / Multiplicity on relations ​\nMultiplicity or cardinality in class diagrams indicates the number of instances of one class that can be linked to an instance of the other class. For example, each company will have one or more employees (not zero), and each employee currently works for zero or one companies.\nMultiplicity notations are placed near the end of an association.\nThe different cardinality options are :\n1 Only 1\n0..1 Zero or One\n1..* One or more\n* Many\nn n (where n>1)\n0..n zero to n (where n>1)\n1..n one to n (where n>1)\nCardinality can be easily defined by placing the text option within quotes \" before or after a given arrow. For example:\n[classA] \"cardinality1\" [Arrow] \"cardinality2\" [ClassB]:LabelText\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram Customer \"1\" --> \"*\" Ticket Student \"1\" --> \"1..*\" Course Galaxy --> \"many\" Star : Contains \nCtrl + Enter|\nAnnotations on classes ​\nIt is possible to annotate classes with markers to provide additional metadata about the class. This can give a clearer indication about its nature. Some common annotations include:\n<<Interface>> To represent an Interface class\n<<Abstract>> To represent an abstract class\n<<Service>> To represent a service class\n<<Enumeration>> To represent an enum\nAnnotations are defined within the opening << and closing >>. There are two ways to add an annotation to a class, and either way the output will be same:\nIn a separate line after a class is defined:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Shape <<interface>> Shape Shape : noOfVertices Shape : draw() \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn a nested structure along with the class definition:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Shape{ <<interface>> noOfVertices draw() } class Color{ <<enumeration>> RED BLUE GREEN WHITE BLACK } \nCtrl + Enter|\nComments can be entered within a class diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text until the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any class diagram syntax.\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram %% This whole line is a comment classDiagram class Shape <<interface>> class Shape{ <<interface>> noOfVertices draw() } \nCtrl + Enter|\nSetting the direction of the diagram ​\nWith class diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction in which the diagram will render:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram direction RL class Student { -idCard : IdCard } class IdCard{ -id : int -name : string } class Bike{ -id : int -name : string } Student \"1\" --o \"1\" IdCard : carries Student \"1\" --o \"1\" Bike : rides \nCtrl + Enter|\nInteraction ​\nIt is possible to bind a click event to a node. The click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in a new browser tab. Note: This functionality is disabled when using securityLevel='strict' and enabled when using securityLevel='loose'.\nYou would define these actions on a separate line after all classes have been declared.\naction className \"reference\" \"tooltip\" click className call callback() \"tooltip\" click className href \"url\" \"tooltip\"\naction is either link or callback, depending on which type of interaction you want to have called\nclassName is the id of the node that the action will be associated with\nreference is either the url link, or the function name for callback.\n(optional) tooltip is a string to be displayed when hovering over element (note: The styles of the tooltip are set by the class .mermaidTooltip.)\nnote: callback function will be called with the nodeId as parameter.\nNotes ​\nIt is possible to add notes on the diagram using note \"line1\\nline2\". A note can be added for a specific class using note for <CLASS NAME> \"line1\\nline2\".\nExamples ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram note \"This is a general note\" note for MyClass \"This is a note for a class\" class MyClass{ } \nCtrl + Enter|\nURL Link:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Shape link Shape \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" class Shape2 click Shape2 href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nCallback:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Shape callback Shape \"callbackFunction\" \"This is a tooltip for a callback\" class Shape2 click Shape2 call callbackFunction() \"This is a tooltip for a callback\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nhtml\n<script> const callbackFunction = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; </script>\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Class01 class Class02 callback Class01 \"callbackFunction\" \"Callback tooltip\" link Class02 \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" class Class03 class Class04 click Class03 call callbackFunction() \"Callback tooltip\" click Class04 href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nSuccess The tooltip functionality and the ability to link to urls are available from version 0.5.2.\nBeginner's tip—a full example using interactive links in an HTML page:\nhtml\n<body> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> classDiagram Animal <|-- Duck Animal <|-- Fish Animal <|-- Zebra Animal : +int age Animal : +String gender Animal: +isMammal() Animal: +mate() class Duck{ +String beakColor +swim() +quack() } class Fish{ -int sizeInFeet -canEat() } class Zebra{ +bool is_wild +run() } callback Duck callback \"Tooltip\" link Zebra \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" </pre> <script> const callback = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; const config = { startOnLoad: true, securityLevel: 'loose', }; mermaid.initialize(config); </script> </body>\nStyling ​\nStyling a node (v10.7.0+) ​\nIt is possible to apply specific styles such as a thicker border or a different background color to an individual node using the style keyword.\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Animal class Mineral style Animal fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style Mineral fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5 \nCtrl + Enter|\nClasses ​\nMore convenient than defining the style every time is to define a class of styles and attach this class to the nodes that should have a different look. This is done by predefining classes in css styles that can be applied from the graph definition using the cssClass statement or the ::: short hand.\nhtml\n<style> .styleClass > rect { fill: #ff0000; stroke: #ffff00; stroke-width: 4px; } </style>\nThen attaching that class to a specific node:\ncssClass \"nodeId1\" styleClass;\nIt is also possible to attach a class to a list of nodes in one statement:\ncssClass \"nodeId1,nodeId2\" styleClass;\nA shorter form of adding a class is to attach the classname to the node using the ::: operator:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Animal:::styleClass \nCtrl + Enter|\nOr:\nCode:\nmermaid\nclassDiagram class Animal:::styleClass { -int sizeInFeet -canEat() } \nCtrl + Enter|\n?> cssClasses cannot be added using this shorthand method at the same time as a relation statement.\n?> Due to limitations with existing markup for class diagrams, it is not currently possible to define css classes within the diagram itself. Coming soon!\nDefault Styles ​\nThe main styling of the class diagram is done with a preset number of css classes. During rendering these classes are extracted from the file located at src/themes/class.scss. The classes used here are described below:\nClassDescription\ng.classGroup text\tStyles for general class text\t\nclassGroup .title\tStyles for general class title\t\ng.classGroup rect\tStyles for class diagram rectangle\t\ng.classGroup line\tStyles for class diagram line\t\n.classLabel .box\tStyles for class label box\t\n.classLabel .label\tStyles for class label text\t\ncomposition\tStyles for composition arrow head and arrow line\t\naggregation\tStyles for aggregation arrow head and arrow line(dashed or solid)\t\ndependency\tStyles for dependency arrow head and arrow line\t\nSample stylesheet ​\nscss\nbody { background: white; } g.classGroup text { fill: $nodeBorder; stroke: none; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', verdana, arial; font-family: var(--mermaid-font-family); font-size: 10px; .title { font-weight: bolder; } } g.classGroup rect { fill: $nodeBkg; stroke: $nodeBorder; } g.classGroup line { stroke: $nodeBorder; stroke-width: 1; } .classLabel .box { stroke: none; stroke-width: 0; fill: $nodeBkg; opacity: 0.5; } .classLabel .label { fill: $nodeBorder; font-size: 10px; } .relation { stroke: $nodeBorder; stroke-width: 1; fill: none; } @mixin composition { fill: $nodeBorder; stroke: $nodeBorder; stroke-width: 1; } #compositionStart { @include composition; } #compositionEnd { @include composition; } @mixin aggregation { fill: $nodeBkg; stroke: $nodeBorder; stroke-width: 1; } #aggregationStart { @include aggregation; } #aggregationEnd { @include aggregation; } #dependencyStart { @include composition; } #dependencyEnd { @include composition; } #extensionStart { @include composition; } #extensionEnd { @include composition; }\nConfiguration ​\nComing soon!",

    "page_content": "Entity Relationship Diagrams | Mermaid\nAn entity–relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types) Wikipedia.\nNote that practitioners of ER modelling almost always refer to entity types simply as entities. For example the CUSTOMER entity type would be referred to simply as the CUSTOMER entity. This is so common it would be inadvisable to do anything else, but technically an entity is an abstract instance of an entity type, and this is what an ER diagram shows - abstract instances, and the relationships between them. This is why entities are always named using singular nouns.\nMermaid can render ER diagrams\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- title: Order example --- erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses \nCtrl + Enter|\nEntity names are often capitalised, although there is no accepted standard on this, and it is not required in Mermaid.\nRelationships between entities are represented by lines with end markers representing cardinality. Mermaid uses the most popular crow's foot notation. The crow's foot intuitively conveys the possibility of many instances of the entity that it connects to.\nER diagrams can be used for various purposes, ranging from abstract logical models devoid of any implementation details, through to physical models of relational database tables. It can be useful to include attribute definitions on ER diagrams to aid comprehension of the purpose and meaning of entities. These do not necessarily need to be exhaustive; often a small subset of attributes is enough. Mermaid allows them to be defined in terms of their type and name.\nCode:\nmermaid\nerDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places CUSTOMER { string name string custNumber string sector } ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains ORDER { int orderNumber string deliveryAddress } LINE-ITEM { string productCode int quantity float pricePerUnit } \nCtrl + Enter|\nWhen including attributes on ER diagrams, you must decide whether to include foreign keys as attributes. This probably depends on how closely you are trying to represent relational table structures. If your diagram is a logical model which is not meant to imply a relational implementation, then it is better to leave these out because the associative relationships already convey the way that entities are associated. For example, a JSON data structure can implement a one-to-many relationship without the need for foreign key properties, using arrays. Similarly an object-oriented programming language may use pointers or references to collections. Even for models that are intended for relational implementation, you might decide that inclusion of foreign key attributes duplicates information already portrayed by the relationships, and does not add meaning to entities. Ultimately, it's your choice.\nSyntax ​\nEntities and Relationships ​\nMermaid syntax for ER diagrams is compatible with PlantUML, with an extension to label the relationship. Each statement consists of the following parts:\n<first-entity> [<relationship> <second-entity> : <relationship-label>]\nWhere:\nfirst-entity is the name of an entity. Names must begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore (from v10.5.0+), and may also contain digits and hyphens.\nrelationship describes the way that both entities inter-relate. See below.\nsecond-entity is the name of the other entity.\nrelationship-label describes the relationship from the perspective of the first entity.\nFor example:\nPROPERTY ||--|{ ROOM : contains\nThis statement can be read as a property contains one or more rooms, and a room is part of one and only one property. You can see that the label here is from the first entity's perspective: a property contains a room, but a room does not contain a property. When considered from the perspective of the second entity, the equivalent label is usually very easy to infer. (Some ER diagrams label relationships from both perspectives, but this is not supported here, and is usually superfluous).\nOnly the first-entity part of a statement is mandatory. This makes it possible to show an entity with no relationships, which can be useful during iterative construction of diagrams. If any other parts of a statement are specified, then all parts are mandatory.\nRelationship Syntax ​\nThe relationship part of each statement can be broken down into three sub-components:\nthe cardinality of the first entity with respect to the second\nwhether the relationship confers identity on a 'child' entity\nthe cardinality of the second entity with respect to the first\nCardinality is a property that describes how many elements of another entity can be related to the entity in question. In the above example a PROPERTY can have one or more ROOM instances associated to it, whereas a ROOM can only be associated with one PROPERTY. In each cardinality marker there are two characters. The outermost character represents a maximum value, and the innermost character represents a minimum value. The table below summarises possible cardinalities.\nValue (left)Value (right)Meaning\n|o\to|\tZero or one\t\n||\t||\tExactly one\t\n}o\to{\tZero or more (no upper limit)\t\n}|\t|{\tOne or more (no upper limit)\t\nAliases\nValue (left)Value (right)Alias for\none or zero\tone or zero\tZero or one\t\nzero or one\tzero or one\tZero or one\t\none or more\tone or more\tOne or more\t\none or many\tone or many\tOne or more\t\nmany(1)\tmany(1)\tOne or more\t\n1+\t1+\tOne or more\t\nzero or more\tzero or more\tZero or more\t\nzero or many\tzero or many\tZero or more\t\nmany(0)\tmany(0)\tZero or more\t\n0+\t0+\tZero or more\t\nonly one\tonly one\tExactly one\t\n1\t1\tExactly one\t\nIdentification ​\nRelationships may be classified as either identifying or non-identifying and these are rendered with either solid or dashed lines respectively. This is relevant when one of the entities in question can not have independent existence without the other. For example a firm that insures people to drive cars might need to store data on NAMED-DRIVERs. In modelling this we might start out by observing that a CAR can be driven by many PERSON instances, and a PERSON can drive many CARs - both entities can exist without the other, so this is a non-identifying relationship that we might specify in Mermaid as: PERSON }|..|{ CAR : \"driver\". Note the two dots in the middle of the relationship that will result in a dashed line being drawn between the two entities. But when this many-to-many relationship is resolved into two one-to-many relationships, we observe that a NAMED-DRIVER cannot exist without both a PERSON and a CAR - the relationships become identifying and would be specified using hyphens, which translate to a solid line:\nAliases\nValueAlias for\nto\tidentifying\t\noptionally to\tnon-identifying\t\nCode:\nmermaid\nerDiagram CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is \nCtrl + Enter|\nAttributes ​\nAttributes can be defined for entities by specifying the entity name followed by a block containing multiple type name pairs, where a block is delimited by an opening { and a closing }. The attributes are rendered inside the entity boxes. For example:\nCode:\nmermaid\nerDiagram CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows CAR { string registrationNumber string make string model } PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is PERSON { string firstName string lastName int age } \nCtrl + Enter|\nThe type values must begin with an alphabetic character and may contain digits, hyphens, underscores, parentheses and square brackets. The name values follow a similar format to type, but may start with an asterisk as another option to indicate an attribute is a primary key. Other than that, there are no restrictions, and there is no implicit set of valid data types.\nEntity Name Aliases (v10.5.0+) ​\nAn alias can be added to an entity using square brackets. If provided, the alias will be showed in the diagram instead of the entity name.\nCode:\nmermaid\nerDiagram p[Person] { string firstName string lastName } a[\"Customer Account\"] { string email } p ||--o| a : has \nCtrl + Enter|\nAttribute Keys and Comments ​\nAttributes may also have a key or comment defined. Keys can be PK, FK or UK, for Primary Key, Foreign Key or Unique Key. To specify multiple key constraints on a single attribute, separate them with a comma (e.g., PK, FK). A comment is defined by double quotes at the end of an attribute. Comments themselves cannot have double-quote characters in them.\nCode:\nmermaid\nerDiagram CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows CAR { string registrationNumber PK string make string model string[] parts } PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is PERSON { string driversLicense PK \"The license #\" string(99) firstName \"Only 99 characters are allowed\" string lastName string phone UK int age } NAMED-DRIVER { string carRegistrationNumber PK, FK string driverLicence PK, FK } MANUFACTURER only one to zero or more CAR : makes \nCtrl + Enter|\nOther Things ​\nIf you want the relationship label to be more than one word, you must use double quotes around the phrase\nIf you don't want a label at all on a relationship, you must use an empty double-quoted string\n(v11.1.0+) If you want a multi-line label on a relationship, use <br /> between the two lines (\"first line<br />second line\")\nStyling ​\nConfig options ​\nFor simple color customization:\nNameUsed as\nfill\tBackground color of an entity or attribute\t\nstroke\tBorder color of an entity or attribute, line color of a relationship\t\nClasses used ​\nThe following CSS class selectors are available for richer styling:\nSelectorDescription\n.er.attributeBoxEven\tThe box containing attributes on even-numbered rows\t\n.er.attributeBoxOdd\tThe box containing attributes on odd-numbered rows\t\n.er.entityBox\tThe box representing an entity\t\n.er.entityLabel\tThe label for an entity\t\n.er.relationshipLabel\tThe label for a relationship\t\n.er.relationshipLabelBox\tThe box surrounding a relationship label\t\n.er.relationshipLine\tThe line representing a relationship between entities",

    "page_content": "State diagrams | MermaidThis is the accessible titleThis is the accessible title\n\"A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the case, while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction.\" Wikipedia\nMermaid can render state diagrams. The syntax tries to be compliant with the syntax used in plantUml as this will make it easier for users to share diagrams between mermaid and plantUml.\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- title: Simple sample --- stateDiagram-v2 [*] --> Still Still --> [*] Still --> Moving Moving --> Still Moving --> Crash Crash --> [*] \nCtrl + Enter|\nOlder renderer:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram [*] --> Still Still --> [*] Still --> Moving Moving --> Still Moving --> Crash Crash --> [*] \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn state diagrams systems are described in terms of states and how one state can change to another state via a transition. The example diagram above shows three states: Still, Moving and Crash. You start in the Still state. From Still you can change to the Moving state. From Moving you can change either back to the Still state or to the Crash state. There is no transition from Still to Crash. (You can't crash if you're still.)\nStates ​\nA state can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest way is to define a state with just an id:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 stateId \nCtrl + Enter|\nAnother way is by using the state keyword with a description as per below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 state \"This is a state description\" as s2 \nCtrl + Enter|\nAnother way to define a state with a description is to define the state id followed by a colon and the description:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 s2 : This is a state description \nCtrl + Enter|\nTransitions ​\nTransitions are path/edges when one state passes into another. This is represented using text arrow, \"-->\".\nWhen you define a transition between two states and the states are not already defined, the undefined states are defined with the id from the transition. You can later add descriptions to states defined this way.\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 s1 --> s2 \nCtrl + Enter|\nIt is possible to add text to a transition to describe what it represents:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 s1 --> s2: A transition \nCtrl + Enter|\nStart and End ​\nThere are two special states indicating the start and stop of the diagram. These are written with the [*] syntax and the direction of the transition to it defines it either as a start or a stop state.\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 [*] --> s1 s1 --> [*] \nCtrl + Enter|\nComposite states ​\nIn a real world use of state diagrams you often end up with diagrams that are multidimensional as one state can have several internal states. These are called composite states in this terminology.\nIn order to define a composite state you need to use the state keyword followed by an id and the body of the composite state between {}. You can name a composite state on a separate line just like a simple state. See the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 [*] --> First state First { [*] --> second second --> [*] } [*] --> NamedComposite NamedComposite: Another Composite state NamedComposite { [*] --> namedSimple namedSimple --> [*] namedSimple: Another simple } \nCtrl + Enter|\nYou can do this in several layers:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 [*] --> First state First { [*] --> Second state Second { [*] --> second second --> Third state Third { [*] --> third third --> [*] } } } \nCtrl + Enter|\nYou can also define transitions also between composite states:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 [*] --> First First --> Second First --> Third state First { [*] --> fir fir --> [*] } state Second { [*] --> sec sec --> [*] } state Third { [*] --> thi thi --> [*] } \nCtrl + Enter|\nYou can not define transitions between internal states belonging to different composite states\nChoice ​\nSometimes you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can do so using <<choice>>.\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 state if_state <<choice>> [*] --> IsPositive IsPositive --> if_state if_state --> False: if n < 0 if_state --> True : if n >= 0 \nCtrl + Enter|\nForks ​\nIt is possible to specify a fork in the diagram using <<fork>> <<join>>.\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 state fork_state <<fork>> [*] --> fork_state fork_state --> State2 fork_state --> State3 state join_state <<join>> State2 --> join_state State3 --> join_state join_state --> State4 State4 --> [*] \nCtrl + Enter|\nNotes ​\nSometimes nothing says it better than a Post-it note. That is also the case in state diagrams.\nHere you can choose to put the note to the right of or to the left of a node.\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 State1: The state with a note note right of State1 Important information! You can write notes. end note State1 --> State2 note left of State2 : This is the note to the left. \nCtrl + Enter|\nConcurrency ​\nAs in plantUml you can specify concurrency using the -- symbol.\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 [*] --> Active state Active { [*] --> NumLockOff NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed -- [*] --> CapsLockOff CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed -- [*] --> ScrollLockOff ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed } \nCtrl + Enter|\nSetting the direction of the diagram ​\nWith state diagrams you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the diagram will render like in this example.\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram direction LR [*] --> A A --> B B --> C state B { direction LR a --> b } B --> D \nCtrl + Enter|\nComments can be entered within a state diagram chart, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram-v2 [*] --> Still Still --> [*] %% this is a comment Still --> Moving Moving --> Still %% another comment Moving --> Crash Crash --> [*] \nCtrl + Enter|\nStyling with classDefs ​\nAs with other diagrams (like flowcharts), you can define a style in the diagram itself and apply that named style to a state or states in the diagram.\nThese are the current limitations with state diagram classDefs:\nCannot be applied to start or end states\nCannot be applied to or within composite states\nThese are in development and will be available in a future version.\nYou define a style using the classDef keyword, which is short for \"class definition\" (where \"class\" means something like a CSS class) followed by a name for the style, and then one or more property-value pairs. Each property-value pair is a valid CSS property name followed by a colon (:) and then a value.\nHere is an example of a classDef with just one property-value pair:\ntxt\nclassDef movement font-style:italic;\nwhere\nthe name of the style is movement\nthe only property is font-style and its value is italic\nIf you want to have more than one property-value pair then you put a comma (,) between each property-value pair.\nHere is an example with three property-value pairs:\ntxt\nclassDef badBadEvent fill:#f00,color:white,font-weight:bold,stroke-width:2px,stroke:yellow\nwhere\nthe name of the style is badBadEvent\nthe first property is fill and its value is #f00\nthe second property is color and its value is white\nthe third property is font-weight and its value is bold\nthe fourth property is stroke-width and its value is 2px\nthe fifth property is stroke and its value is yellow\nApply classDef styles to states ​\nThere are two ways to apply a classDef style to a state:\nuse the class keyword to apply a classDef style to one or more states in a single statement, or\nuse the ::: operator to apply a classDef style to a state as it is being used in a transition statement (e.g. with an arrow to/from another state)\n1. class statement ​\nA class statement tells Mermaid to apply the named classDef to one or more classes. The form is:\ntxt\nclass [one or more state names, separated by commas] [name of a style defined with classDef]\nHere is an example applying the badBadEvent style to a state named Crash:\ntxt\nclass Crash badBadEvent\nHere is an example applying the movement style to the two states Moving and Crash:\ntxt\nclass Moving, Crash movement\nHere is a diagram that shows the examples in use. Note that the Crash state has two classDef styles applied: movement and badBadEvent\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram direction TB accTitle: This is the accessible title accDescr: This is an accessible description classDef notMoving fill:white classDef movement font-style:italic classDef badBadEvent fill:#f00,color:white,font-weight:bold,stroke-width:2px,stroke:yellow [*]--> Still Still --> [*] Still --> Moving Moving --> Still Moving --> Crash Crash --> [*] class Still notMoving class Moving, Crash movement class Crash badBadEvent class end badBadEvent \nCtrl + Enter|\n2. ::: operator to apply a style to a state ​\nYou can apply a classDef style to a state using the ::: (three colons) operator. The syntax is\ntxt\n[state]:::[style name]\nYou can use this in a diagram within a statement using a class. This includes the start and end states. For example:\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram direction TB accTitle: This is the accessible title accDescr: This is an accessible description classDef notMoving fill:white classDef movement font-style:italic; classDef badBadEvent fill:#f00,color:white,font-weight:bold,stroke-width:2px,stroke:yellow [*] --> Still:::notMoving Still --> [*] Still --> Moving:::movement Moving --> Still Moving --> Crash:::movement Crash:::badBadEvent --> [*] \nCtrl + Enter|\nSpaces in state names ​\nSpaces can be added to a state by first defining the state with an id and then referencing the id later.\nIn the following example there is a state with the id yswsii and description Your state with spaces in it. After it has been defined, yswsii is used in the diagram in the first transition ([*] --> yswsii) and also in the transition to YetAnotherState (yswsii --> YetAnotherState). (yswsii has been styled so that it is different from the other states.)\nCode:\nmermaid\nstateDiagram classDef yourState font-style:italic,font-weight:bold,fill:white yswsii: Your state with spaces in it [*] --> yswsii:::yourState [*] --> SomeOtherState SomeOtherState --> YetAnotherState yswsii --> YetAnotherState YetAnotherState --> [*] \nCtrl + Enter|",

These new shapes provide more options to represent processes, decisions, events, data storage visually, and other elements within your flowcharts, improving clarity and semantic meaning.\nNew Syntax for Shape Definition\nMermaid now supports a general syntax for defining shape types to accommodate the growing number of shapes. This syntax allows you to assign specific shapes to nodes using a clear and flexible format:\nThis syntax creates a node A as a rectangle. It renders in the same way as A[\"A\"], or A.\nComplete List of New Shapes ​\nBelow is a comprehensive list of the newly introduced shapes and their corresponding semantic meanings, short names, and

between nodes ​\nNodes can be connected with links/edges. It is possible to have different types of links or attach a text string to a link.\nA link with arrow head ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B \nCtrl + Enter|\nAn open link ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A --- B \nCtrl + Enter|\nText on links ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-- This is the text! ---B \nCtrl + Enter|\nor\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A---|This is the text|B \nCtrl + Enter|\nA link with arrow head and text ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->|text|B \nCtrl + Enter|\nor\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-- text -->B \nCtrl + Enter|\nDotted link ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-.->B; \nCtrl + Enter|\nDotted link with text ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-. text .-> B \nCtrl + Enter|\nThick link ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A ==> B \nCtrl + Enter|\nThick link with text ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A == text ==> B \nCtrl + Enter|\nAn invisible link ​\nThis can be a useful tool in some instances where you want to alter the default positioning of a node.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A ~~~ B \nCtrl + Enter|\nChaining of links ​\nIt is possible declare many links in the same line as per below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C \nCtrl + Enter|\nIt is also possible to declare multiple nodes links in the same line as per below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR a --> b & c--> d \nCtrl + Enter|\nYou can then describe dependencies in a very expressive way. Like the one-liner below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB A & B--> C & D \nCtrl + Enter|\nIf you describe the same diagram using the basic syntax, it will take four lines. A word of warning, one could go overboard with this making the flowchart harder to read in markdown form. The Swedish word lagom comes to mind. It means, not too much and not too little. This goes for expressive syntaxes as well.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB A --> C A --> D B --> C B --> D \nCtrl + Enter|\nNew arrow types ​\nThere are new types of arrows supported:\ncircle edge\ncross edge\nCircle edge example ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A --o B \nCtrl + Enter|\nCross edge example ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A --x B \nCtrl + Enter|\nMulti directional arrows ​\nThere is the possibility to use multidirectional arrows.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A o--o B B <--> C C x--x D \nCtrl + Enter|\nMinimum length of a link ​\nEach node in the flowchart is ultimately assigned to a rank in the rendered graph, i.e. to a vertical or horizontal level (depending on the flowchart orientation), based on the nodes to which it is linked. By default, links can span any number of ranks, but you can ask for any link to be longer than the others by adding extra dashes in the link definition.\nIn the following example, two extra dashes are added in the link from node B to node E, so that it spans two more ranks than regular links:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD A[Start] --> B{Is it?} B -->|Yes| C[OK] C --> D[Rethink] D --> B B ---->|No| E[End] \nCtrl + Enter|\nNote Links may still be made longer than the requested number of ranks by the rendering engine to accommodate other requests.\nWhen the link label is written in the middle of the link, the extra dashes must be added on the right side of the link. The following example is equivalent to the previous one:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD A[Start] --> B{Is it?} B -- Yes --> C[OK] C --> D[Rethink] D --> B B -- No ----> E[End] \nCtrl + Enter|\nFor dotted or thick links, the characters to add are equals signs or dots, as summed up in the following table:\nLength123\nNormal\t---\t----\t-----\t\nNormal with arrow\t-->\t--->\t---->\t\nThick\t===\t====\t=====\t\nThick with arrow\t==>\t===>\t====>\t\nDotted\t-.-\t-..-\t-...-\t\nDotted with arrow\t-.->\t-..->\t-...->\t\nSpecial characters that break syntax ​\nIt is possible to put text within quotes in order to render more troublesome characters. As in the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR id1[\"This is the (text) in the box\"] \nCtrl + Enter|\nEntity codes to escape characters ​\nIt is possible to escape characters using the syntax exemplified here.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A[\"A double quote:#quot;\"] --> B[\"A dec char:#9829;\"] \nCtrl + Enter|\nNumbers given are base 10, so # can be encoded as #35;. It is also supported to use HTML character names.\nSubgraphs ​\nsubgraph title graph definition end\nAn example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph one a1-->a2 end subgraph two b1-->b2 end subgraph three c1-->c2 end \nCtrl + Enter|\nYou can also set an explicit id for the subgraph.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph ide1 [one] a1-->a2 end \nCtrl + Enter|\nflowcharts ​\nWith the graphtype flowchart it is also possible to set edges to and from subgraphs as in the flowchart below.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph one a1-->a2 end subgraph two b1-->b2 end subgraph three c1-->c2 end one --> two three --> two two --> c2 \nCtrl + Enter|\nDirection in subgraphs ​\nWith the graphtype flowcharts you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the subgraph will render like in this example.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR subgraph TOP direction TB subgraph B1 direction RL i1 -->f1 end subgraph B2 direction BT i2 -->f2 end end A --> TOP --> B B1 --> B2 \nCtrl + Enter|\nLimitation ​\nIf any of a subgraph's nodes are linked to the outside, subgraph direction will be ignored. Instead the subgraph will inherit the direction of the parent graph:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR subgraph subgraph1 direction TB top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom] end subgraph subgraph2 direction TB top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom] end %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them: %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained outside --> subgraph1 %% Link *within* subgraph2: %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR) outside ---> top2 \nCtrl + Enter|\nMarkdown Strings ​\nThe \"Markdown Strings\" feature enhances flowcharts and mind maps by offering a more versatile string type, which supports text formatting options such as bold and italics, and automatically wraps text within labels.\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"htmlLabels\": false}} }%% flowchart LR subgraph \"One\" a(\"`The **cat** in the hat`\") -- \"edge label\" --> b{{\"`The **dog** in the hog`\"}} end subgraph \"`**Two**`\" c(\"`The **cat** in the hat`\") -- \"`Bold **edge label**`\" --> d(\"The dog in the hog\") end \nCtrl + Enter|\nFormatting:\nFor bold text, use double asterisks (**) before and after the text.\nFor italics, use single asterisks (*) before and after the text.\nWith traditional strings, you needed to add <br> tags for text to wrap in nodes. However, markdown strings automatically wrap text when it becomes too long and allows you to start a new line by simply using a newline character instead of a <br> tag.\nThis feature is applicable to node labels, edge labels, and subgraph labels.\nThe auto wrapping can be disabled by using\n--- config: markdownAutoWrap: false --- graph LR\nInteraction ​\nIt is possible to bind a click event to a node, the click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in a new browser tab.\nINFO\nThis functionality is disabled when using securityLevel='strict' and enabled when using securityLevel='loose'.\nclick nodeId callback click nodeId call callback()\nnodeId is the id of the node\ncallback is the name of a javascript function defined on the page displaying the graph, the function will be called with the nodeId as parameter.\nExamples of tooltip usage below:\nhtml\n<script> window.callback = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; </script>\nThe tooltip text is surrounded in double quotes. The styles of the tooltip are set by the class .mermaidTooltip.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D click A callback \"Tooltip for a callback\" click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" click C call callback() \"Tooltip for a callback\" click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nSuccess The tooltip functionality and the ability to link to urls are available from version 0.5.2.\n?> Due to limitations with how Docsify handles JavaScript callback functions, an alternate working demo for the above code can be viewed at this jsfiddle.\nLinks are opened in the same browser tab/window by default. It is possible to change this by adding a link target to the click definition (_self, _blank, _parent and _top are supported):\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D D-->E click A \"https://www.github.com\" _blank click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"Open this in a new tab\" _blank click C href \"https://www.github.com\" _blank click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"Open this in a new tab\" _blank \nCtrl + Enter|\nBeginner's tip—a full example using interactive links in a html context:\nhtml\n<body> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> flowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D click A callback \"Tooltip\" click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" click C call callback() \"Tooltip\" click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" </pre> <script> window.callback = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; const config = { startOnLoad: true, flowchart: { useMaxWidth: true, htmlLabels: true, curve: 'cardinal' }, securityLevel: 'loose', }; mermaid.initialize(config); </script> </body>\nComments ​\nComments can be entered within a flow diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any flow syntax\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR %% this is a comment A -- text --> B{node} A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C \nCtrl + Enter|\nStyling and classes ​\nStyling links ​\nIt is possible to style links. For instance, you might want to style a link that is going backwards in the flow. As links have no ids in the same way as nodes, some other way of deciding what style the links should be attached to is required. Instead of ids, the order number of when the link was defined in the graph is used, or use default to apply to all links. In the example below the style defined in the linkStyle statement will belong to the fourth link in the graph:\nlinkStyle 3 stroke:#ff3,stroke-width:4px,color:red;\nIt is also possible to add style to multiple links in a single statement, by separating link numbers with commas:\nlinkStyle 1,2,7 color:blue;\nStyling line curves ​\nIt is possible to style the type of curve used for lines between items, if the default method does not meet your needs. Available curve styles include basis, bumpX, bumpY, cardinal, catmullRom, linear, monotoneX, monotoneY, natural, step, stepAfter, and stepBefore.\nIn this example, a left-to-right graph uses the stepBefore curve style:\n%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'stepBefore' } } }%% graph LR\nFor a full list of available curves, including an explanation of custom curves, refer to the Shapes documentation in the d3-shape project.\nStyling a node ​\nIt is possible to apply specific styles such as a thicker border or a different background color to a node.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR id1(Start)-->id2(Stop) style id1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style id2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5 \nCtrl + Enter|\nClasses ​\nMore convenient than defining the style every time is to define a class of styles and attach this class to the nodes that should have a different look.\nA class definition looks like the example below:\nclassDef className fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nAlso, it is possible to define style to multiple classes in one statement:\nclassDef firstClassName,secondClassName font-size:12pt;\nAttachment of a class to a node is done as per below:\nIt is also possible to attach a class to a list of nodes in one statement:\nclass nodeId1,nodeId2 className;\nA shorter form of adding a class is to attach the classname to the node using the :::operator as per below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A:::someclass --> B classDef someclass fill:#f96 \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis form can be used when declaring multiple links between nodes:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A:::foo & B:::bar --> C:::foobar classDef foo stroke:#f00 classDef bar stroke:#0f0 classDef foobar stroke:#00f \nCtrl + Enter|\nCSS classes ​\nIt is also possible to predefine classes in CSS styles that can be applied from the graph definition as in the example below:\nExample style\nhtml\n<style> .cssClass > rect { fill: #ff0000; stroke: #ffff00; stroke-width: 4px; } </style>\nExample definition\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B[AAA<span>BBB</span>] B-->D class A cssClass \nCtrl + Enter|\nDefault class ​\nIf a class is named default it will be assigned to all classes without specific class definitions.\nclassDef default fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nBasic support for fontawesome ​\nIt is possible to add icons from fontawesome.\nThe icons are accessed via the syntax fa:#icon class name#.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"] B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner) B-->E(A fa:fa-camera-retro perhaps?) \nCtrl + Enter|\nMermaid supports Font Awesome if the CSS is included on the website. Mermaid does not have any restriction on the version of Font Awesome that can be used.\nPlease refer the Official Font Awesome Documentation on how to include it in your website.\nAdding this snippet in the <head> would add support for Font Awesome v6.5.1\nhtml\n<link href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\nCustom icons ​\nIt is possible to use custom icons served from Font Awesome as long as the website imports the corresponding kit.\nNote that this is currently a paid feature from Font Awesome.\nFor custom icons, you need to use the fak prefix.\nExample\nflowchart TD B[fa:fa-twitter] %% standard icon B-->E(fak:fa-custom-icon-name) %% custom icon\nAnd trying to render it\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"] B-->C[\"fab:fa-truck-bold a custom icon\"] \nCtrl + Enter|\nGraph declarations with spaces between vertices and link and without semicolon ​\nIn graph declarations, the statements also can now end without a semicolon. After release 0.2.16, ending a graph statement with semicolon is just optional. So the below graph declaration is also valid along with the old declarations of the graph.\nA single space is allowed between vertices and the link. However there should not be any space between a vertex and its text and a link and its text. The old syntax of graph declaration will also work and hence this new feature is optional and is introduced to improve readability.\nBelow is the new declaration of the graph edges which is also valid along with the old declaration of the graph edges.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge) B --> C{Decision} C -->|One| D[Result one] C -->|Two| E[Result two] \nCtrl + Enter|\nConfiguration ​\nRenderer ​\nThe layout of the diagram is done with the renderer. The default renderer is dagre.\nStarting with Mermaid version 9.4, you can use an alternate renderer named elk. The elk renderer is better for larger and/or more complex diagrams.\nThe elk renderer is an experimental feature. You can change the renderer to elk by adding this directive:\n%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"defaultRenderer\": \"elk\"}} }%%\nINFO\nNote that the site needs to use mermaid version 9.4+ for this to work and have this featured enabled in the lazy-loading configuration.\nWidth ​\nIt is possible to adjust the width of the rendered flowchart.\nThis is done by defining mermaid.flowchartConfig or by the CLI to use a JSON file with the configuration. How to use the CLI is described in the mermaidCLI page. mermaid.flowchartConfig can be set to a JSON string with config parameters or the corresponding object.\njavascript\nmermaid.flowchartConfig = { width: 100% }",

    "page_content": "Gantt diagrams | Mermaid\nA Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, first developed by Karol Adamiecki in 1896, and independently by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates a project schedule and the amount of time it would take for any one project to finish. Gantt charts illustrate number of days between the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project.\nA note to users ​\nGantt Charts will record each scheduled task as one continuous bar that extends from the left to the right. The x axis represents time and the y records the different tasks and the order in which they are to be completed.\nIt is important to remember that when a date, day, or collection of dates specific to a task are \"excluded\", the Gantt Chart will accommodate those changes by extending an equal number of days, towards the right, not by creating a gap inside the task. As shown here \nHowever, if the excluded dates are between two tasks that are set to start consecutively, the excluded dates will be skipped graphically and left blank, and the following task will begin after the end of the excluded dates. As shown here \nA Gantt chart is useful for tracking the amount of time it would take before a project is finished, but it can also be used to graphically represent \"non-working days\", with a few tweaks.\nMermaid can render Gantt diagrams as SVG, PNG or a MarkDown link that can be pasted into docs.\nCode:\nmermaid\ngantt title A Gantt Diagram dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD section Section A task :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d Another task :after a1, 20d section Another Task in Another :2014-01-12, 12d another task :24d \nCtrl + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nCode:\nmermaid\ngantt dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD title Adding GANTT diagram functionality to mermaid excludes weekends %% (`excludes` accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week (\"sunday\") or \"weekends\", but not the word \"weekdays\".) section A section Completed task :done, des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08 Active task :active, des2, 2014-01-09, 3d Future task : des3, after des2, 5d Future task2 : des4, after des3, 5d section Critical tasks Completed task in the critical line :crit, done, 2014-01-06,24h Implement parser and jison :crit, done, after des1, 2d Create tests for parser :crit, active, 3d Future task in critical line :crit, 5d Create tests for renderer :2d Add to mermaid :until isadded Functionality added :milestone, isadded, 2014-01-25, 0d section Documentation Describe gantt syntax :active, a1, after des1, 3d Add gantt diagram to demo page :after a1 , 20h Add another diagram to demo page :doc1, after a1 , 48h section Last section Describe gantt syntax :after doc1, 3d Add gantt diagram to demo page :20h Add another diagram to demo page :48h \nCtrl + Enter|\nTasks are by default sequential. A task start date defaults to the end date of the preceding task.\nA colon, :, separates the task title from its metadata. Metadata items are separated by a comma, ,. Valid tags are active, done, crit, and milestone. Tags are optional, but if used, they must be specified first. After processing the tags, the remaining metadata items are interpreted as follows:\nIf a single item is specified, it determines when the task ends. It can either be a specific date/time or a duration. If a duration is specified, it is added to the start date of the task to determine the end date of the task, taking into account any exclusions.\nIf two items are specified, the last item is interpreted as in the previous case. The first item can either specify an explicit start date/time (in the format specified by dateFormat) or reference another task using after <otherTaskID> [[otherTaskID2 [otherTaskID3]]...]. In the latter case, the start date of the task will be set according to the latest end date of any referenced task.\nIf three items are specified, the last two will be interpreted as in the previous case. The first item will denote the ID of the task, which can be referenced using the later <taskID> syntax.\nMetadata syntaxStart dateEnd dateID\n<taskID>, <startDate>, <endDate>\tstartdate as interpreted using dateformat\tendDate as interpreted using dateformat\ttaskID\t\n<taskID>, <startDate>, <length>\tstartdate as interpreted using dateformat\tStart date + length\ttaskID\t\n<taskID>, after <otherTaskId>, <endDate>\tEnd date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tendDate as interpreted using dateformat\ttaskID\t\n<taskID>, after <otherTaskId>, <length>\tEnd date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tStart date + length\ttaskID\t\n<taskID>, <startDate>, until <otherTaskId>\tstartdate as interpreted using dateformat\tStart date of previously specified task otherTaskID\ttaskID\t\n<taskID>, after <otherTaskId>, until <otherTaskId>\tEnd date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tStart date of previously specified task otherTaskID\ttaskID\t\n<startDate>, <endDate>\tstartdate as interpreted using dateformat\tenddate as interpreted using dateformat\tn/a\t\n<startDate>, <length>\tstartdate as interpreted using dateformat\tStart date + length\tn/a\t\nafter <otherTaskID>, <endDate>\tEnd date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tenddate as interpreted using dateformat\tn/a\t\nafter <otherTaskID>, <length>\tEnd date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tStart date + length\tn/a\t\n<startDate>, until <otherTaskId>\tstartdate as interpreted using dateformat\tStart date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tn/a\t\nafter <otherTaskId>, until <otherTaskId>\tEnd date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tStart date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tn/a\t\n<endDate>\tEnd date of preceding task\tenddate as interpreted using dateformat\tn/a\t\n<length>\tEnd date of preceding task\tStart date + length\tn/a\t\nuntil <otherTaskId>\tEnd date of preceding task\tStart date of previously specified task otherTaskID\tn/a\t\nINFO\nSupport for keyword until was added in (v10.9.0+). This can be used to define a task which is running until some other specific task or milestone starts.\nFor simplicity, the table does not show the use of multiple tasks listed with the after keyword. Here is an example of how to use it and how it's interpreted:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngantt apple :a, 2017-07-20, 1w banana :crit, b, 2017-07-23, 1d cherry :active, c, after b a, 1d kiwi :d, 2017-07-20, until b c \nCtrl + Enter|\nTitle ​\nThe title is an optional string to be displayed at the top of the Gantt chart to describe the chart as a whole.\nExcludes ​\nThe excludes is an optional attribute that accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week (\"sunday\") or \"weekends\", but not the word \"weekdays\". These date will be marked on the graph, and be excluded from the duration calculation of tasks. Meaning that if there are excluded dates during a task interval, the number of 'skipped' days will be added to the end of the task to ensure the duration is as specified in the code.\nWeekend (v\\11.0.0+) ​\nWhen excluding weekends, it is possible to configure the weekends to be either Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday. By default weekends are Saturday and Sunday. To define the weekend start day, there is an optional attribute weekend that can be added in a new line followed by either friday or saturday.\nCode:\nmermaid\ngantt title A Gantt Diagram Excluding Fri - Sat weekends dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD excludes weekends weekend friday section Section A task :a1, 2024-01-01, 30d Another task :after a1, 20d \nCtrl + Enter|\nSection statements ​\nYou can divide the chart into various sections, for example to separate different parts of a project like development and documentation.\nTo do so, start a line with the section keyword and give it a name. (Note that unlike with the title for the entire chart, this name is required.\nMilestones ​\nYou can add milestones to the diagrams. Milestones differ from tasks as they represent a single instant in time and are identified by the keyword milestone. Below is an example on how to use milestones. As you may notice, the exact location of the milestone is determined by the initial date for the milestone and the \"duration\" of the task this way: initial date+duration/2.\nCode:\nmermaid\ngantt dateFormat HH:mm axisFormat %H:%M Initial milestone : milestone, m1, 17:49, 2m Task A : 10m Task B : 5m Final milestone : milestone, m2, 18:08, 4m \nCtrl + Enter|\nSetting dates ​\ndateFormat defines the format of the date input of your gantt elements. How these dates are represented in the rendered chart output are defined by axisFormat.\nInput date format ​\nThe default input date format is YYYY-MM-DD.

    "page_content": "Quadrant Chart | Mermaid\nA quadrant chart is a visual representation of data that is divided into four quadrants. It is used to plot data points on a two-dimensional grid, with one variable represented on the x-axis and another variable represented on the y-axis. The quadrants are determined by dividing the chart into four equal parts based on a set of criteria that is specific to the data being analyzed. Quadrant charts are often used to identify patterns and trends in data, and to prioritize actions based on the position of data points within the chart. They are commonly used in business, marketing, and risk management, among other fields.\nExample ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nquadrantChart title Reach and engagement of campaigns x-axis Low Reach --> High Reach y-axis Low Engagement --> High Engagement quadrant-1 We should expand quadrant-2 Need to promote quadrant-3 Re-evaluate quadrant-4 May be improved Campaign A: [0.3, 0.6] Campaign B: [0.45, 0.23] Campaign C: [0.57, 0.69] Campaign D: [0.78, 0.34] Campaign E: [0.40, 0.34] Campaign F: [0.35, 0.78] \nCtrl + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nINFO\nIf there are no points available in the chart both axis text and quadrant will be rendered in the center of the respective quadrant. If there are points x-axis labels will rendered from the left of the respective quadrant also they will be displayed at the bottom of the chart, and y-axis labels will be rendered at the bottom of the respective quadrant, the quadrant text will render at the top of the respective quadrant.\nINFO\nFor points x and y value min value is 0 and max value is 1.\nTitle ​\nThe title is a short description of the chart and it will always render on top of the chart.\nExample ​\nquadrantChart title This is a sample example\nx-axis ​\nThe x-axis determines what text would be displayed in the x-axis. In x-axis there is two part left and right you can pass both or you can pass only left. The statement should start with x-axis then the left axis text followed by the delimiter --> then right axis text.\nExample ​\nx-axis <text> --> <text> both the left and right axis text will be rendered.\nx-axis <text> only the left axis text will be rendered.\ny-axis ​\nThe y-axis determines what text would be displayed in the y-axis.

Words denoted in angle brackets, such as <word>, are enumerated keywords that have options elaborated in a table. user_defined_... is use in any place where user input is expected.\nAn important note on user text: all input can be surrounded in quotes or not. For example, both Id: \"here is an example\" and Id: here is an example are both valid. However, users must be careful with unquoted input. The parser will fail if another keyword is detected.\nRequirement ​\nA requirement definition contains a requirement type, name, id, text, risk, and verification method. The syntax follows:\n<type> user_defined_name { id: user_defined_id text: user_defined text risk: <risk> verifymethod: <method> }\nType, risk, and method are enumerations defined in SysML.\nKeywordOptions\nType\trequirement, functionalRequirement, interfaceRequirement, performanceRequirement, physicalRequirement, designConstraint\t\nRisk\tLow, Medium, High\t\nVerificationMethod\tAnalysis, Inspection, Test, Demonstration\t\nElement ​\nAn element definition contains an element name, type, and document reference. These three are all user defined. The element feature is intended to be lightweight but allow requirements to be connected to portions of other documents.\nelement user_defined_name { type: user_defined_type docref: user_defined_ref }\nRelationship ​\nRelationships are comprised of a source node, destination node, and relationship type.\nEach follows the definition format of\n{name of source} - <type> -> {name of destination}\nor\n{name of destination} <- <type> - {name of source}\n\"name of source\" and \"name of destination\" should be names of requirement or element nodes defined elsewhere.\nA relationship type can be one of contains, copies, derives, satisfies, verifies, refines, or traces.\nEach relationship is labeled in the diagram.\nLarger Example ​\nThis example uses all features of the diagram.\nCode:\nmermaid\nrequirementDiagram requirement test_req { id: 1 text: the test text. risk: high verifymethod: test } functionalRequirement test_req2 { id: 1.1 text: the second test text. risk: low verifymethod: inspection } performanceRequirement test_req3 { id: 1.2 text: the third test text. risk: medium verifymethod: demonstration } interfaceRequirement test_req4 { id: 1.2.1 text: the fourth test text. risk: medium verifymethod: analysis } physicalRequirement test_req5 { id: 1.2.2 text: the fifth test text. risk: medium verifymethod: analysis } designConstraint test_req6 { id: 1.2.3 text: the sixth test text. risk: medium verifymethod: analysis } element test_entity { type: simulation } element test_entity2 { type: word doc docRef: reqs/test_entity } element test_entity3 { type: \"test suite\" docRef: github.com/all_the_tests } test_entity - satisfies -> test_req2 test_req - traces -> test_req2 test_req - contains -> test_req3 test_req3 - contains -> test_req4 test_req4 - derives -> test_req5 test_req5 - refines -> test_req6 test_entity3 - verifies -> test_req5 test_req <- copies - test_entity2 \nCtrl + Enter|",

    "page_content": "Gitgraph Diagrams | Mermaid\nA Git Graph is a pictorial representation of git commits and git actions(commands) on various branches.\nThese kind of diagram are particularly helpful to developers and devops teams to share their Git branching strategies. For example, it makes it easier to visualize how git flow works.\nMermaid can render Git diagrams\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- title: Example Git diagram --- gitGraph commit commit branch develop checkout develop commit commit checkout main merge develop commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn Mermaid, we support the basic git operations like:\ncommit : Representing a new commit on the current branch.\nbranch : To create & switch to a new branch, setting it as the current branch.\ncheckout : To checking out an existing branch and setting it as the current branch.\nmerge : To merge an existing branch onto the current branch.\nWith the help of these key git commands, you will be able to draw a gitgraph in Mermaid very easily and quickly. Entity names are often capitalized, although there is no accepted standard on this, and it is not required in Mermaid.\nNOTE: checkout and switch can be used interchangeably.\nSyntax ​\nMermaid syntax for a gitgraph is very straight-forward and simple. It follows a declarative-approach, where each commit is drawn on the timeline in the diagram, in order of its occurrences/presence in code. Basically, it follows the insertion order for each command.\nFirst thing you do is to declare your diagram type using the gitgraph keyword. This gitgraph keyword, tells Mermaid that you wish to draw a gitgraph, and parse the diagram code accordingly.\nEach gitgraph, is initialized with main branch. So unless you create a different branch, by-default the commits will go to the main branch. This is driven with how git works, where in the beginning you always start with the main branch (formerly called as master branch). And by-default, main branch is set as your current branch.\nYou make use of commit keyword to register a commit on the current branch. Let see how this works:\nA simple gitgraph showing three commits on the default (main) branch:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIf you look closely at the previous example, you can see the default branch main along with three commits. Also, notice that by default each commit has been given a unique & random ID. What if you wanted to give your own custom ID to a commit? Yes, it is possible to do that with Mermaid.\nAdding custom commit id ​\nFor a given commit you may specify a custom ID at the time of declaring it using the id attribute, followed by : and your custom value within a \"\" quote. For example: commit id: \"your_custom_id\"\nLet us see how this works with the help of the following diagram:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit id: \"Alpha\" commit id: \"Beta\" commit id: \"Gamma\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, we have given our custom IDs to the commits.\nModifying commit type ​\nIn Mermaid, a commit can be of three type, which render a bit different in the diagram. These types are:\nNORMAL : Default commit type. Represented by a solid circle in the diagram\nREVERSE : To emphasize a commit as a reverse commit. Represented by a crossed solid circle in the diagram.\nHIGHLIGHT : To highlight a particular commit in the diagram. Represented by a filled rectangle in the diagram.\nFor a given commit you may specify its type at the time of declaring it using the type attribute, followed by : and the required type option discussed above. For example: commit type: HIGHLIGHT\nNOTE: If no commit type is specified, NORMAL is picked as default.\nLet us see how these different commit type look with the help of the following diagram:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit id: \"Normal\" commit commit id: \"Reverse\" type: REVERSE commit commit id: \"Highlight\" type: HIGHLIGHT commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, we have specified different types to each commit. Also, see how we have included both id and type together at the time of declaring our commits.\nAdding Tags ​\nFor a given commit you may decorate it as a tag, similar to the concept of tags or release version in git world. You can attach a custom tag at the time of declaring a commit using the tag attribute, followed by : and your custom value within \"\" quote. For example: commit tag: \"your_custom_tag\"\nLet us see how this works with the help of the following diagram:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit commit id: \"Normal\" tag: \"v1.0.0\" commit commit id: \"Reverse\" type: REVERSE tag: \"RC_1\" commit commit id: \"Highlight\" type: HIGHLIGHT tag: \"8.8.4\" commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, we have given custom tags to the commits. Also, see how we have combined all these attributes in a single commit declaration. You can mix-match these attributes as you like.\nCreate a new branch ​\nIn Mermaid, in-order to create a new branch, you make use of the branch keyword. You also need to provide a name of the new branch. The name has to be unique and cannot be that of an existing branch. A branch name that could be confused for a keyword must be quoted within \"\". Usage examples: branch develop, branch \"cherry-pick\"\nWhen Mermaid, reads the branch keyword, it creates a new branch and sets it as the current branch. Equivalent to you creating a new branch and checking it out in Git world.\nLet see this in an example:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit commit branch develop commit commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, see how we started with default main branch, and pushed two commits on that. Then we created the develop branch, and all commits afterwards are put on the develop branch as it became the current branch.\nChecking out an existing branch ​\nIn Mermaid, in order to switch to an existing branch, you make use of the checkout keyword. You also need to provide a name of an existing branch. If no branch is found with the given name, it will result in console error. Usage example: checkout develop\nWhen Mermaid, reads the checkout keyword, it finds the given branch and sets it as the current branch. Equivalent to checking out a branch in the Git world.\nLet see modify our previous example:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit commit branch develop commit commit commit checkout main commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, see how we started with default main branch, and pushed two commits on that. Then we created the develop branch, and all three commits afterwards are put on the develop branch as it became the current branch. After this we made use of the checkout keyword to set the current branch as main, and all commit that follow are registered against the current branch, i.e. main.\nMerging two branches ​\nIn Mermaid, in order to merge or join to an existing branch, you make use of the merge keyword. You also need to provide the name of an existing branch to merge from. If no branch is found with the given name, it will result in console error. Also, you can only merge two separate branches, and cannot merge a branch with itself. In such case an error is throw.\nUsage example: merge develop\nWhen Mermaid, reads the merge keyword, it finds the given branch and its head commit (the last commit on that branch), and joins it with the head commit on the current branch. Each merge results in a merge commit, represented in the diagram with filled double circle.\nLet us modify our previous example to merge our two branches:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit commit branch develop commit commit commit checkout main commit commit merge develop commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, see how we started with default main branch, and pushed two commits on that. Then we created the develop branch, and all three commits afterwards are put on the develop branch as it became the current branch. After this we made use of the checkout keyword to set the current branch as main, and all commits that follow are registered against the current branch, i.e. main. After this we merge the develop branch onto the current branch main, resulting in a merge commit. Since the current branch at this point is still main, the last two commits are registered against that.\nYou can also decorate your merge with similar attributes as you did for the commit using:\nid--> To override the default ID with custom ID\ntag--> To add a custom tag to your merge commit\ntype--> To override the default shape of merge commit. Here you can use other commit type mentioned earlier.\nAnd you can choose to use none, some or all of these attributes together. For example: merge develop id: \"my_custom_id\" tag: \"my_custom_tag\" type: REVERSE\nLet us see how this works with the help of the following diagram:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit id: \"1\" commit id: \"2\" branch nice_feature checkout nice_feature commit id: \"3\" checkout main commit id: \"4\" checkout nice_feature branch very_nice_feature checkout very_nice_feature commit id: \"5\" checkout main commit id: \"6\" checkout nice_feature commit id: \"7\" checkout main merge nice_feature id: \"customID\" tag: \"customTag\" type: REVERSE checkout very_nice_feature commit id: \"8\" checkout main commit id: \"9\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nCherry Pick commit from another branch ​\nSimilar to how 'git' allows you to cherry-pick a commit from another branch onto the current branch, Mermaid also supports this functionality. You can also cherry-pick a commit from another branch using the cherry-pick keyword.\nTo use the cherry-pick keyword, you must specify the id using the id attribute, followed by : and your desired commit id within a \"\" quote. For example:\ncherry-pick id: \"your_custom_id\"\nHere, a new commit representing the cherry-pick is created on the current branch, and is visually highlighted in the diagram with a cherry and a tag depicting the commit id from which it is cherry-picked from.\nA few important rules to note here are:\nYou need to provide the id for an existing commit to be cherry-picked. If given commit id does not exist it will result in an error. For this, make use of the commit id:$value format of declaring commits. See the examples from above.\nThe given commit must not exist on the current branch. The cherry-picked commit must always be a different branch than the current branch.\nCurrent branch must have at least one commit, before you can cherry-pick, otherwise it will cause an error is throw.\nWhen cherry-picking a merge commit, providing a parent commit ID is mandatory. If the parent attribute is omitted or an invalid parent commit ID is provided, an error will be thrown.\nThe specified parent commit must be an immediate parent of the merge commit being cherry-picked.\nLet see an example:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph commit id: \"ZERO\" branch develop branch release commit id:\"A\" checkout main commit id:\"ONE\" checkout develop commit id:\"B\" checkout main merge develop id:\"MERGE\" commit id:\"TWO\" checkout release cherry-pick id:\"MERGE\" parent:\"B\" commit id:\"THREE\" checkout develop commit id:\"C\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nGitgraph specific configuration options ​\nIn Mermaid, you have the option to configure the gitgraph diagram. You can configure the following options:\nshowBranches : Boolean, default is true. If set to false, the branches are not shown in the diagram.\nshowCommitLabel : Boolean, default is true. If set to false, the commit labels are not shown in the diagram.\nmainBranchName : String, default is main. The name of the default/root branch.\nmainBranchOrder : Position of the main branch in the list of branches. default is 0, meaning, by default main branch is the first in the order.\nparallelCommits: Boolean, default is false. If set to true, commits x distance away from the parent are shown at the same level in the diagram.\nLet's look at them one by one.\nHiding Branch names and lines ​\nSometimes you may want to hide the branch names and lines from the diagram. You can do this by using the showBranches keyword. By default its value is true. You can set it to false using directives.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': false}} }%% gitGraph commit branch hotfix checkout hotfix commit branch develop checkout develop commit id:\"ash\" tag:\"abc\" branch featureB checkout featureB commit type:HIGHLIGHT checkout main checkout hotfix commit type:NORMAL checkout develop commit type:REVERSE checkout featureB commit checkout main merge hotfix checkout featureB commit checkout develop branch featureA commit checkout develop merge hotfix checkout featureA commit checkout featureB commit checkout develop merge featureA branch release checkout release commit checkout main commit checkout release merge main checkout develop merge release \nCtrl + Enter|\nCommit labels Layout: Rotated or Horizontal ​\nMermaid supports two types of commit labels layout. The default layout is rotated, which means the labels are placed below the commit circle, rotated at 45 degrees for better readability. This is particularly useful for commits with long labels.\nThe other option is horizontal, which means the labels are placed below the commit circle centred horizontally, and are not rotated. This is particularly useful for commits with short labels.\nYou can change the layout of the commit labels by using the rotateCommitLabel keyword in the directive. It defaults to true, which means the commit labels are rotated.\nUsage example: Rotated commit labels\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': true}} }%% gitGraph commit id: \"feat(api): ...\" commit id: \"a\" commit id: \"b\" commit id: \"fix(client): .extra long label..\" branch c2 commit id: \"feat(modules): ...\" commit id: \"test(client): ...\" checkout main commit id: \"fix(api): ...\" commit id: \"ci: ...\" branch b1 commit branch b2 commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nUsage example: Horizontal commit labels\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'rotateCommitLabel': false}} }%% gitGraph commit id: \"feat(api): ...\" commit id: \"a\" commit id: \"b\" commit id: \"fix(client): .extra long label..\" branch c2 commit id: \"feat(modules): ...\" commit id: \"test(client): ...\" checkout main commit id: \"fix(api): ...\" commit id: \"ci: ...\" branch b1 commit branch b2 commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nHiding commit labels ​\nSometimes you may want to hide the commit labels from the diagram. You can do this by using the showCommitLabel keyword. By default its value is true. You can set it to false using directives.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': false,'showCommitLabel': false}} }%% gitGraph commit branch hotfix checkout hotfix commit branch develop checkout develop commit id:\"ash\" branch featureB checkout featureB commit type:HIGHLIGHT checkout main checkout hotfix commit type:NORMAL checkout develop commit type:REVERSE checkout featureB commit checkout main merge hotfix checkout featureB commit checkout develop branch featureA commit checkout develop merge hotfix checkout featureA commit checkout featureB commit checkout develop merge featureA branch release checkout release commit checkout main commit checkout release merge main checkout develop merge release \nCtrl + Enter|\nCustomizing main branch name ​\nSometimes you may want to customize the name of the main/default branch. You can do this by using the mainBranchName keyword. By default its value is main. You can set it to any string using directives.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'MetroLine1'}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\"NewYork\" commit id:\"Dallas\" branch MetroLine2 commit id:\"LosAngeles\" commit id:\"Chicago\" commit id:\"Houston\" branch MetroLine3 commit id:\"Phoenix\" commit type: HIGHLIGHT id:\"Denver\" commit id:\"Boston\" checkout MetroLine1 commit id:\"Atlanta\" merge MetroLine3 commit id:\"Miami\" commit id:\"Washington\" merge MetroLine2 tag:\"MY JUNCTION\" commit id:\"Boston\" commit id:\"Detroit\" commit type:REVERSE id:\"SanFrancisco\" \nCtrl + Enter|\nLook at the imaginary railroad map created using Mermaid. Here, we have changed the default main branch name to MetroLine1.\nCustomizing branch ordering ​\nIn Mermaid, by default the branches are shown in the order of their definition or appearance in the diagram code.\nSometimes you may want to customize the order of the branches. You can do this by using the order keyword next the branch definition. You can set it to a positive number.\nMermaid follows the given precedence order of the order keyword.\nMain branch is always shown first as it has default order value of 0. (unless its order is modified and changed from 0 using the mainBranchOrder keyword in the config)\nNext, All branches without an order are shown in the order of their appearance in the diagram code.\nNext, All branches with an order are shown in the order of their order value.\nTo fully control the order of all the branches, you must define order for all the branches.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true}} }%% gitGraph commit branch test1 order: 3 branch test2 order: 2 branch test3 order: 1 \nCtrl + Enter|\nLook at the diagram, all the branches are following the order defined.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchOrder': 2}} }%% gitGraph commit branch test1 order: 3 branch test2 branch test3 branch test4 order: 1 \nCtrl + Enter|\nLook at the diagram, here, all the branches without a specified order are drawn in their order of definition. Then, test4 branch is drawn because the order of 1. Then, main branch is drawn because the order of 2. And, lastly test1is drawn because the order of 3.\nNOTE: Because we have overridden the mainBranchOrder to 2, the main branch is not drawn in the beginning, instead follows the ordering.\nHere, we have changed the default main branch name to MetroLine1.\nOrientation (v10.3.0+) ​\nMermaid supports three graph orientations: Left-to-Right (default), Top-to-Bottom, and Bottom-to-Top.\nYou can set this with either LR: (for Left-to-Right), TB: (for Top-to-Bottom) or BT: (for Bottom-to-Top) after gitGraph.\nLeft to Right (default, LR:) ​\nIn Mermaid, the default orientation is for commits to run from left to right and for branches to be stacked on top of one another.\nHowever, you can set this explicitly with LR: after gitGraph.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph LR: commit commit branch develop commit commit checkout main commit commit merge develop commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nTop to Bottom (TB:) ​\nIn TB (Top-to-Bottom) orientation, the commits run from top to bottom of the graph and branches are arranged side-by-side.\nTo orient the graph this way, you need to add TB: after gitGraph.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph TB: commit commit branch develop commit commit checkout main commit commit merge develop commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nBottom to Top (BT:) (v11.0.0+) ​\nIn BT (Bottom-to-Top) orientation, the commits run from bottom to top of the graph and branches are arranged side-by-side.\nTo orient the graph this way, you need to add BT: after gitGraph.\nUsage example:\nCode:\nmermaid\ngitGraph BT: commit commit branch develop commit commit checkout main commit commit merge develop commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nParallel commits (v10.8.0+) ​\nCommits in Mermaid display temporal information in gitgraph by default. For example if two commits are one commit away from its parent, the commit that was made earlier is rendered closer to its parent. You can turn this off by enabling the parallelCommits flag.\nTemporal Commits (default, parallelCommits: false) ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- config: gitGraph: parallelCommits: false --- gitGraph: commit branch develop commit commit checkout main commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nParallel commits (parallelCommits: true) ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- config: gitGraph: parallelCommits: true --- gitGraph: commit branch develop commit commit checkout main commit commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nThemes ​\nMermaid supports a bunch of pre-defined themes which you can use to find the right one for you. PS: you can actually override an existing theme's variable to get your own custom theme going. Learn more about theming your diagram here.\nThe following are the different pre-defined theme options:\nbase\nforest\ndark\ndefault\nneutral\nNOTE: To change theme you can either use the initialize call or directives. Learn more about directives Let's put them to use, and see how our sample diagram looks in different themes:\nBase Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base' } }%% gitGraph commit branch hotfix checkout hotfix commit branch develop checkout develop commit id:\"ash\" tag:\"abc\" branch featureB checkout featureB commit type:HIGHLIGHT checkout main checkout hotfix commit type:NORMAL checkout develop commit type:REVERSE checkout featureB commit checkout main merge hotfix checkout featureB commit checkout develop branch featureA commit checkout develop merge hotfix checkout featureA commit checkout featureB commit checkout develop merge featureA branch release checkout release commit checkout main commit checkout release merge main checkout develop merge release \nCtrl + Enter|\nForest Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'forest' } }%% gitGraph commit branch hotfix checkout hotfix commit branch develop checkout develop commit id:\"ash\" tag:\"abc\" branch featureB checkout featureB commit type:HIGHLIGHT checkout main checkout hotfix commit type:NORMAL checkout develop commit type:REVERSE checkout featureB commit checkout main merge hotfix checkout featureB commit checkout develop branch featureA commit checkout develop merge hotfix checkout featureA commit checkout featureB commit checkout develop merge featureA branch release checkout release commit checkout main commit checkout release merge main checkout develop merge release \nCtrl + Enter|\nDefault Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' } }%% gitGraph commit type:HIGHLIGHT branch hotfix checkout hotfix commit branch develop checkout develop commit id:\"ash\" tag:\"abc\" branch featureB checkout featureB commit type:HIGHLIGHT checkout main checkout hotfix commit type:NORMAL checkout develop commit type:REVERSE checkout featureB commit checkout main merge hotfix checkout featureB commit checkout develop branch featureA commit checkout develop merge hotfix checkout featureA commit checkout featureB commit checkout develop merge featureA branch release checkout release commit checkout main commit checkout release merge main checkout develop merge release \nCtrl + Enter|\nDark Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark' } }%% gitGraph commit branch hotfix checkout hotfix commit branch develop checkout develop commit id:\"ash\" tag:\"abc\" branch featureB checkout featureB commit type:HIGHLIGHT checkout main checkout hotfix commit type:NORMAL checkout develop commit type:REVERSE checkout featureB commit checkout main merge hotfix checkout featureB commit checkout develop branch featureA commit checkout develop merge hotfix checkout featureA commit checkout featureB commit checkout develop merge featureA branch release checkout release commit checkout main commit checkout release merge main checkout develop merge release \nCtrl + Enter|\nNeutral Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'neutral' } }%% gitGraph commit branch hotfix checkout hotfix commit branch develop checkout develop commit id:\"ash\" tag:\"abc\" branch featureB checkout featureB commit type:HIGHLIGHT checkout main checkout hotfix commit type:NORMAL checkout develop commit type:REVERSE checkout featureB commit checkout main merge hotfix checkout featureB commit checkout develop branch featureA commit checkout develop merge hotfix checkout featureA commit checkout featureB commit checkout develop merge featureA branch release checkout release commit checkout main commit checkout release merge main checkout develop merge release \nCtrl + Enter|\nCustomize using Theme Variables ​\nMermaid allows you to customize your diagram using theme variables which govern the look and feel of various elements of the diagram.\nFor understanding let us take a sample diagram with theme default, the default values of the theme variables is picked automatically from the theme. Later on we will see how to override the default values of the theme variables.\nSee how the default theme is used to set the colors for the branches:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' } }%% gitGraph commit branch develop commit tag:\"v1.0.0\" commit checkout main commit type: HIGHLIGHT commit merge develop commit branch featureA commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nIMPORTANT: ​\nMermaid supports the theme variables to override the default values for up to 8 branches, i.e., you can set the color/styling of up to 8 branches using theme variables. After this threshold of 8 branches, the theme variables are reused in the cyclic manner, i.e. the 9th branch will use the color/styling of the 1st branch, or the branch at index position '8' will use the color/styling of the branch at index position '0'. More on this in the next section. See examples on Customizing branch label colors below\nCustomizing branch colors ​\nYou can customize the branch colors using the git0 to git7 theme variables. Mermaid allows you to set the colors for up-to 8 branches, where git0 variable will drive the value of the first branch, git1 will drive the value of the second branch and so on.\nNOTE: Default values for these theme variables are picked from the selected theme. If you want to override the default values, you can use the initialize call to add your custom theme variable values.\nExample:\nNow let's override the default values for the git0 to git3 variables:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'git0': '#ff0000', 'git1': '#00ff00', 'git2': '#0000ff', 'git3': '#ff00ff', 'git4': '#00ffff', 'git5': '#ffff00', 'git6': '#ff00ff', 'git7': '#00ffff' } } }%% gitGraph commit branch develop commit tag:\"v1.0.0\" commit checkout main commit type: HIGHLIGHT commit merge develop commit branch featureA commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nSee how the branch colors are changed to the values specified in the theme variables.\nCustomizing branch label colors ​\nYou can customize the branch label colors using the gitBranchLabel0 to gitBranchLabel7 theme variables. Mermaid allows you to set the colors for up-to 8 branches, where gitBranchLabel0 variable will drive the value of the first branch label, gitBranchLabel1 will drive the value of the second branch label and so on.\nLets see how the default theme is used to set the colors for the branch labels:\nNow let's override the default values for the gitBranchLabel0 to gitBranchLabel2 variables:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'gitBranchLabel0': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel1': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel2': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel3': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel4': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel5': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel6': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel7': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel8': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel9': '#ffffff' } } }%% gitGraph checkout main branch branch1 branch branch2 branch branch3 branch branch4 branch branch5 branch branch6 branch branch7 branch branch8 branch branch9 checkout branch1 commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nHere, you can see that branch8 and branch9 colors and the styles are being picked from branch at index position 0 (main) and 1(branch1) respectively, i.e., branch themeVariables are repeated cyclically.\nCustomizing Commit colors ​\nYou can customize commit using the commitLabelColor and commitLabelBackground theme variables for changes in the commit label color and background color respectively.\nExample: Now let's override the default values for the commitLabelColor to commitLabelBackground variables:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'commitLabelColor': '#ff0000', 'commitLabelBackground': '#00ff00' } } }%% gitGraph commit branch develop commit tag:\"v1.0.0\" commit checkout main commit type: HIGHLIGHT commit merge develop commit branch featureA commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nSee how the commit label color and background color are changed to the values specified in the theme variables.\nCustomizing Commit Label Font Size ​\nYou can customize commit using the commitLabelFontSize theme variables for changing in the font size of the commit label .\nExample: Now let's override the default values for the commitLabelFontSize variable:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'commitLabelColor': '#ff0000', 'commitLabelBackground': '#00ff00', 'commitLabelFontSize': '16px' } } }%% gitGraph commit branch develop commit tag:\"v1.0.0\" commit checkout main commit type: HIGHLIGHT commit merge develop commit branch featureA commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nSee how the commit label font size changed.\nCustomizing Tag Label Font Size ​\nYou can customize commit using the tagLabelFontSize theme variables for changing in the font size of the tag label .\nExample: Now let's override the default values for the tagLabelFontSize variable:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'commitLabelColor': '#ff0000', 'commitLabelBackground': '#00ff00', 'tagLabelFontSize': '16px' } } }%% gitGraph commit branch develop commit tag:\"v1.0.0\" commit checkout main commit type: HIGHLIGHT commit merge develop commit branch featureA commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nSee how the tag label font size changed.\nCustomizing Tag colors ​\nYou can customize tag using the tagLabelColor,tagLabelBackground and tagLabelBorder theme variables for changes in the tag label color,tag label background color and tag label border respectively. Example: Now let's override the default values for the tagLabelColor, tagLabelBackground and to tagLabelBorder variables:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'tagLabelColor': '#ff0000', 'tagLabelBackground': '#00ff00', 'tagLabelBorder': '#0000ff' } } }%% gitGraph commit branch develop commit tag:\"v1.0.0\" commit checkout main commit type: HIGHLIGHT commit merge develop commit branch featureA commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nSee how the tag colors are changed to the values specified in the theme variables.\nCustomizing Highlight commit colors ​\nYou can customize the highlight commit colors in relation to the branch it is on using the gitInv0 to gitInv7 theme variables. Mermaid allows you to set the colors for up-to 8 branches specific highlight commit, where gitInv0 variable will drive the value of the first branch's highlight commits, gitInv1 will drive the value of the second branch's highlight commit label and so on.\nExample:\nNow let's override the default values for the git0 to git3 variables:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'gitInv0': '#ff0000' } } }%% gitGraph commit branch develop commit tag:\"v1.0.0\" commit checkout main commit type: HIGHLIGHT commit merge develop commit branch featureA commit \nCtrl + Enter|\nSee how the highlighted commit color on the first branch is changed to the value specified in the theme variable gitInv0.",

    "page_content": "Mindmap | Mermaid\nMindmap: This is an experimental diagram for now. The syntax and properties can change in future releases. The syntax is stable except for the icon integration which is the experimental part.\n\"A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information into a hierarchy, showing relationships among pieces of the whole. It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.\" Wikipedia\nAn example of a mindmap. ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap root((mindmap)) Origins Long history ::icon(fa fa-book) Popularisation British popular psychology author Tony Buzan Research On effectiveness<br/>and features On Automatic creation Uses Creative techniques Strategic planning Argument mapping Tools Pen and paper Mermaid \nCtrl + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nThe syntax for creating Mindmaps is simple and relies on indentation for setting the levels in the hierarchy.\nIn the following example you can see how there are 3 different levels. One with starting at the left of the text and another level with two rows starting at the same column, defining the node A. At the end there is one more level where the text is indented further than the previous lines defining the nodes B and C.\nIn summary is a simple text outline where there is one node at the root level called Root which has one child A. A in turn has two children Band C. In the diagram below we can see this rendered as a mindmap.\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap Root A B C \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this way we can use a text outline to generate a hierarchical mindmap.\nDifferent shapes ​\nMermaid mindmaps can show nodes using different shapes. When specifying a shape for a node the syntax is similar to flowchart nodes, with an id followed by the shape definition and with the text within the shape delimiters. Where possible we try/will try to keep the same shapes as for flowcharts, even though they are not all supported from the start.\nMindmap can show the following shapes:\nSquare ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap id[I am a square] \nCtrl + Enter|\nRounded square ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap id(I am a rounded square) \nCtrl + Enter|\nCircle ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap id((I am a circle)) \nCtrl + Enter|\nBang ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap id))I am a bang(( \nCtrl + Enter|\nCloud ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap id)I am a cloud( \nCtrl + Enter|\nHexagon ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap id{{I am a hexagon}} \nCtrl + Enter|\nDefault ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap I am the default shape \nCtrl + Enter|\nMore shapes will be added, beginning with the shapes available in flowcharts.\nIcons and classes ​\nIcons ​\nAs with flowcharts you can add icons to your nodes but with an updated syntax. The styling for the font based icons are added during the integration so that they are available for the web page. This is not something a diagram author can do but has to be done with the site administrator or the integrator. Once the icon fonts are in place you add them to the mind map nodes using the ::icon() syntax. You place the classes for the icon within the parenthesis like in the following example where icons for material design and Font Awesome 5 are displayed. The intention is that this approach should be used for all diagrams supporting icons. Experimental feature: This wider scope is also the reason Mindmaps are experimental as this syntax and approach could change.\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap Root A ::icon(fa fa-book) B(B) ::icon(mdi mdi-skull-outline) \nCtrl + Enter|\nClasses ​\nAgain the syntax for adding classes is similar to flowcharts. You can add classes using a triple colon following a number of css classes separated by space. In the following example one of the nodes has two custom classes attached urgent turning the background red and the text white and large increasing the font size:\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap Root A[A] :::urgent large B(B) C \nCtrl + Enter|\nThese classes need to be supplied by the site administrator.\nUnclear indentation ​\nThe actual indentation does not really matter only compared with the previous rows. If we take the previous example and disrupt it a little we can see how the calculations are performed. Let us start with placing C with a smaller indentation than B but larger then A.\nThis outline is unclear as B clearly is a child of A but when we move on to C the clarity is lost. C is not a child of B with a higher indentation nor does it have the same indentation as B. The only thing that is clear is that the first node with smaller indentation, indicating a parent, is A. Then Mermaid relies on this known truth and compensates for the unclear indentation and selects A as a parent of C leading till the same diagram with B and C as siblings.\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap Root A B C \nCtrl + Enter|\nMarkdown Strings ​\nThe \"Markdown Strings\" feature enhances mind maps by offering a more versatile string type, which supports text formatting options such as bold and italics, and automatically wraps text within labels.\nCode:\nmermaid\nmindmap id1[\"`**Root** with a second line Unicode works too: 🤓`\"] id2[\"`The dog in **the** hog... a *very long text* that wraps to a new line`\"] id3[Regular labels still works] \nCtrl + Enter|\nFormatting:\nFor bold text, use double asterisks ** before and after the text.\nFor italics, use single asterisks * before and after the text.\nWith traditional strings, you needed to add \ntags for text to wrap in nodes. However, markdown strings automatically wrap text when it becomes too long and allows you to start a new line by simply using a newline character instead of a \ntag.\nIntegrating with your library/website. ​\nMindmap uses the experimental lazy loading & async rendering features which could change in the future. From version 9.4.0 this diagram is included in mermaid but use lazy loading in order to keep the size of mermaid down. This is important in order to be able to add additional diagrams going forward.\nYou can still use the pre 9.4.0 method to add mermaid with mindmaps to a web page:\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@9.3.0/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; import mindmap from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mermaid-js/mermaid-mindmap@9.3.0/dist/mermaid-mindmap.esm.min.mjs'; await mermaid.registerExternalDiagrams([mindmap]); </script>\nFrom version 9.4.0 you can simplify this code to:\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; </script>\nYou can also refer the implementation in the live editor here to see how the async loading is done.",

    "page_content": "Timeline Diagram | Mermaid\nTimeline: This is an experimental diagram for now. The syntax and properties can change in future releases. The syntax is stable except for the icon integration which is the experimental part.\n\"A timeline is a type of diagram used to illustrate a chronology of events, dates, or periods of time. It is usually presented graphically to indicate the passing of time, and it is usually organized chronologically. A basic timeline presents a list of events in chronological order, usually using dates as markers. A timeline can also be used to show the relationship between events, such as the relationship between the events of a person's life\" (Wikipedia).\nAn example of a timeline ​\nCode:\nmermaid\ntimeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter \nCtrl + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nThe syntax for creating Timeline diagram is simple. You always start with the timeline keyword to let mermaid know that you want to create a timeline diagram.\nAfter that there is a possibility to add a title to the timeline. This is done by adding a line with the keyword title followed by the title text.\nThen you add the timeline data, where you always start with a time period, followed by a colon and then the text for the event. Optionally you can add a second colon and then the text for the event. So, you can have one or more events per time period.\njson\n{time period} : {event}\nor\njson\n{time period} : {event} : {event}\nor\njson\n{time period} : {event} : {event} : {event}\nNOTE: Both time period and event are simple text, and not limited to numbers.\nLet us look at the syntax for the example above.\nCode:\nmermaid\ntimeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this way we can use a text outline to generate a timeline diagram. The sequence of time period and events is important, as it will be used to draw the timeline. The first time period will be placed at the left side of the timeline, and the last time period will be placed at the right side of the timeline.\nSimilarly, the first event will be placed at the top for that specific time period, and the last event will be placed at the bottom.\nGrouping of time periods in sections/ages ​\nYou can group time periods in sections/ages. This is done by adding a line with the keyword section followed by the section name.\nAll subsequent time periods will be placed in this section until a new section is defined.\nIf no section is defined, all time periods will be placed in the default section.\nLet us look at an example, where we have grouped the time periods in sections.\nCode:\nmermaid\ntimeline title Timeline of Industrial Revolution section 17th-20th century Industry 1.0 : Machinery, Water power, Steam <br>power Industry 2.0 : Electricity, Internal combustion engine, Mass production Industry 3.0 : Electronics, Computers, Automation section 21st century Industry 4.0 : Internet, Robotics, Internet of Things Industry 5.0 : Artificial intelligence, Big data, 3D printing \nCtrl + Enter|\nAs you can see, the time periods are placed in the sections, and the sections are placed in the order they are defined.\nAll time periods and events under a given section follow a similar color scheme. This is done to make it easier to see the relationship between time periods and events.\nWrapping of text for long time-periods or events ​\nBy default, the text for time-periods and events will be wrapped if it is too long. This is done to avoid that the text is drawn outside the diagram.\nYou can also use <br> to force a line break.\nLet us look at another example, where we have a long time period, and a long event.\nCode:\nmermaid\ntimeline title England's History Timeline section Stone Age 7600 BC : Britain's oldest known house was built in Orkney, Scotland 6000 BC : Sea levels rise and Britain becomes an island.<br> The people who live here are hunter-gatherers. section Bronze Age 2300 BC : People arrive from Europe and settle in Britain. <br>They bring farming and metalworking. : New styles of pottery and ways of burying the dead appear. 2200 BC : The last major building works are completed at Stonehenge.<br> People now bury their dead in stone circles. : The first metal objects are made in Britain.Some other nice things happen. it is a good time to be alive. \nCtrl + Enter|\nCode:\nmermaid\ntimeline title MermaidChart 2023 Timeline section 2023 Q1 <br> Release Personal Tier Bullet 1 : sub-point 1a : sub-point 1b : sub-point 1c Bullet 2 : sub-point 2a : sub-point 2b section 2023 Q2 <br> Release XYZ Tier Bullet 3 : sub-point <br> 3a : sub-point 3b : sub-point 3c Bullet 4 : sub-point 4a : sub-point 4b \nCtrl + Enter|\nStyling of time periods and events ​\nAs explained earlier, each section has a color scheme, and each time period and event under a section follow the similar color scheme.\nHowever, if there is no section defined, then we have two possibilities:\nStyle time periods individually, i.e. each time period(and its corresponding events) will have its own color scheme. This is the DEFAULT behavior.\nCode:\nmermaid\ntimeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter \nCtrl + Enter|\nNOTE: that there are no sections defined, and each time period and its corresponding events will have its own color scheme.\nDisable the multiColor option using the disableMultiColor option. This will make all time periods and events follow the same color scheme.\nYou will need to add this option either via mermaid.initialize function or directives.\njavascript\nmermaid.initialize({ theme: 'base', startOnLoad: true, logLevel: 0, timeline: { disableMulticolor: false, }, ... ...\nlet us look at same example, where we have disabled the multiColor option.\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'timeline': {'disableMulticolor': true}}}%% timeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter \nCtrl + Enter|\nCustomizing Color scheme ​\nYou can customize the color scheme using the cScale0 to cScale11 theme variables, which will change the background colors. Mermaid allows you to set unique colors for up-to 12 sections, where cScale0 variable will drive the value of the first section or time-period, cScale1 will drive the value of the second section and so on. In case you have more than 12 sections, the color scheme will start to repeat.\nIf you also want to change the foreground color of a section, you can do so use theme variables corresponding cScaleLabel0 to cScaleLabel11 variables.\nNOTE: Default values for these theme variables are picked from the selected theme. If you want to override the default values, you can use the initialize call to add your custom theme variable values.\nExample:\nNow let's override the default values for the cScale0 to cScale2 variables:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' , 'themeVariables': { 'cScale0': '#ff0000', 'cScaleLabel0': '#ffffff', 'cScale1': '#00ff00', 'cScale2': '#0000ff', 'cScaleLabel2': '#ffffff' } } }%% timeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter 2007 : Tumblr 2008 : Instagram 2010 : Pinterest \nCtrl + Enter|\nSee how the colors are changed to the values specified in the theme variables.\nThemes ​\nMermaid supports a bunch of pre-defined themes which you can use to find the right one for you. PS: you can actually override an existing theme's variable to get your own custom theme going. Learn more about theming your diagram here.\nThe following are the different pre-defined theme options:\nbase\nforest\ndark\ndefault\nneutral\nNOTE: To change theme you can either use the initialize call or directives. Learn more about directives Let's put them to use, and see how our sample diagram looks in different themes:\nBase Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base' } }%% timeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter 2007 : Tumblr 2008 : Instagram 2010 : Pinterest \nCtrl + Enter|\nForest Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'forest' } }%% timeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter 2007 : Tumblr 2008 : Instagram 2010 : Pinterest \nCtrl + Enter|\nDark Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark' } }%% timeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter 2007 : Tumblr 2008 : Instagram 2010 : Pinterest \nCtrl + Enter|\nDefault Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'default' } }%% timeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter 2007 : Tumblr 2008 : Instagram 2010 : Pinterest \nCtrl + Enter|\nNeutral Theme ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'neutral' } }%% timeline title History of Social Media Platform 2002 : LinkedIn 2004 : Facebook : Google 2005 : Youtube 2006 : Twitter 2007 : Tumblr 2008 : Instagram 2010 : Pinterest \nCtrl + Enter|\nIntegrating with your library/website ​\nTimeline uses experimental lazy loading & async rendering features which could change in the future.The lazy loading is important in order to be able to add additional diagrams going forward.\nYou can use this method to add mermaid including the timeline diagram to a web page:\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; </script>\nYou can also refer the implementation in the live editor here to see how the async loading is done.",

    "page_content": "XY Chart | Mermaid\nIn the context of mermaid-js, the XY chart is a comprehensive charting module that encompasses various types of charts that utilize both x-axis and y-axis for data representation. Presently, it includes two fundamental chart types: the bar chart and the line chart. These charts are designed to visually display and analyze data that involve two numerical variables.\nIt's important to note that while the current implementation of mermaid-js includes these two chart types, the framework is designed to be dynamic and adaptable. Therefore, it has the capacity for expansion and the inclusion of additional chart types in the future. This means that users can expect an evolving suite of charting options within the XY chart module, catering to various data visualization needs as new chart types are introduced over time.\nExample ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nxychart-beta title \"Sales Revenue\" x-axis [jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec] y-axis \"Revenue (in $)\" 4000 --> 11000 bar [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 10500, 11000, 10200, 9200, 8500, 7000, 6000] line [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 10500, 11000, 10200, 9200, 8500, 7000, 6000] \nCtrl + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nINFO\nAll text values that contain only one word can be written without \".

They are composed of blocks and connectors, where blocks represent the fundamental components or functions, and connectors show the relationship or flow between these components. This method of diagramming is essential in various fields such as engineering, software development, and process management.\nThe primary purpose of block diagrams is to provide a high-level view of a system, allowing for easy understanding and analysis without delving into the intricate details of each component. This makes them particularly useful for simplifying complex systems and for explaining the overall structure and interaction of components within a system.\nMany people use mermaid flowcharts for this purpose. A side-effect of this is that the automatic layout sometimes move shapes to positions that the diagram maker does not want. Block diagrams use a different approach. In this diagram we give the author full control over where the shapes are positioned.\nGeneral Use Cases ​\nBlock diagrams have a wide range of applications across various industries and disciplines. Some of the key use cases include:\nSoftware Architecture: In software development, block diagrams can be used to illustrate the architecture of a software application. This includes showing how different modules or services interact, data flow, and high-level component interaction.\nNetwork Diagrams: Block diagrams are ideal for representing network architectures in IT and telecommunications. They can depict how different network devices and services are interconnected, including routers, switches, firewalls, and the flow of data across the network.\nProcess Flowcharts: In business and manufacturing, block diagrams can be employed to create process flowcharts. These flowcharts represent various stages of a business or manufacturing process, helping to visualize the sequence of steps, decision points, and the flow of control.\nElectrical Systems: Engineers use block diagrams to represent electrical systems and circuitry. They can illustrate the high-level structure of an electrical system, the interaction between different electrical components, and the flow of electrical currents.\nEducational Purposes: Block diagrams are also extensively used in educational materials to explain complex concepts and systems in a simplified manner. They help in breaking down and visualizing scientific theories, engineering principles, and technological systems.\nThese examples demonstrate the versatility of block diagrams in providing clear and concise representations of complex systems. Their simplicity and clarity make them a valuable tool for professionals across various fields to communicate complex ideas effectively.\nIn the following sections, we will delve into the specifics of creating and manipulating block diagrams using Mermaid, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced configurations and styling.\nCreating block diagrams with Mermaid is straightforward and accessible. This section introduces the basic syntax and structure needed to start building simple diagrams. Understanding these foundational concepts is key to efficiently utilizing Mermaid for more complex diagramming tasks.\nSimple Block Diagrams ​\nBasic Structure ​\nAt its core, a block diagram consists of blocks representing different entities or components. In Mermaid, these blocks are easily created using simple text labels. The most basic form of a block diagram can be a series of blocks without any connectors.\nExample - Simple Block Diagram: To create a simple block diagram with three blocks labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c', the syntax is as follows:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta a b c \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis example will produce a horizontal sequence of three blocks. Each block is automatically spaced and aligned for optimal readability.\nDefining the number of columns to use ​\nColumn Usage ​\nWhile simple block diagrams are linear and straightforward, more complex systems may require a structured layout. Mermaid allows for the organization of blocks into multiple columns, facilitating the creation of more intricate and detailed diagrams.\nExample - Multi-Column Diagram: In scenarios where you need to distribute blocks across multiple columns, you can specify the number of columns and arrange the blocks accordingly. Here's how to create a block diagram with three columns and four blocks, where the fourth block appears in a second row:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta columns 3 a b c d \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis syntax instructs Mermaid to arrange the blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' across three columns, wrapping to the next row as needed. This feature is particularly useful for representing layered or multi-tiered systems, such as network layers or hierarchical structures.\nThese basic building blocks of Mermaid's block diagrams provide a foundation for more complex diagramming. The simplicity of the syntax allows for quick creation and iteration of diagrams, making it an efficient tool for visualizing ideas and concepts. In the next section, we'll explore advanced block configuration options, including setting block widths and creating composite blocks.\n3. Advanced Block Configuration ​\nBuilding upon the basics, this section delves into more advanced features of block diagramming in Mermaid. These features allow for greater flexibility and complexity in diagram design, accommodating a wider range of use cases and scenarios.\nSetting Block Width ​\nSpanning Multiple Columns ​\nIn more complex diagrams, you may need blocks that span multiple columns to emphasize certain components or to represent larger entities. Mermaid allows for the adjustment of block widths to cover multiple columns, enhancing the diagram's readability and structure.\nExample - Block Spanning Multiple Columns: To create a block diagram where one block spans across two columns, you can specify the desired width for each block:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta columns 3 a[\"A label\"] b:2 c:2 d \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, the block labeled \"A wide one\" spans two columns, while blocks 'b', 'c', and 'd' are allocated their own columns. This flexibility in block sizing is crucial for accurately representing systems with components of varying significance or size.\nCreating Composite Blocks ​\nNested Blocks ​\nComposite blocks, or blocks within blocks, are an advanced feature in Mermaid's block diagram syntax. They allow for the representation of nested or hierarchical systems, where one component encompasses several subcomponents.\nExample - Composite Blocks: Creating a composite block involves defining a parent block and then nesting other blocks within it. Here's how to define a composite block with nested elements:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta block D end A[\"A: I am a wide one\"] \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this syntax, 'D' is a nested block within a larger parent block. This feature is particularly useful for depicting complex structures, such as a server with multiple services or a department within a larger organizational framework.\nColumn Width Dynamics ​\nAdjusting Widths ​\nMermaid also allows for dynamic adjustment of column widths based on the content of the blocks. The width of the columns is determined by the widest block in the column, ensuring that the diagram remains balanced and readable.\nExample - Dynamic Column Widths: In diagrams with varying block sizes, Mermaid automatically adjusts the column widths to fit the largest block in each column. Here's an example:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta columns 3 a:3 block:group1:2 columns 2 h i j k end g block:group2:3 %% columns auto (default) l m n o p q r end \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis example demonstrates how Mermaid dynamically adjusts the width of the columns to accommodate the widest block, in this case, 'a' and the composite block 'e'. This dynamic adjustment is essential for creating visually balanced and easy-to-understand diagrams.\nMerging Blocks Horizontally: In scenarios where you need to stack blocks horizontally, you can use column width to accomplish the task. Blocks can be arranged vertically by putting them in a single column. Here is how you can create a block diagram in which 4 blocks are stacked on top of each other:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta block columns 1 a[\"A label\"] b c d end \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, the width of the merged block dynamically adjusts to the width of the largest child block.\nWith these advanced configuration options, Mermaid's block diagrams can be tailored to represent a wide array of complex systems and structures. The flexibility offered by these features enables users to create diagrams that are both informative and visually appealing. In the following sections, we will explore further capabilities, including different block shapes and linking options.\n4. Block Varieties and Shapes ​\nMermaid's block diagrams are not limited to standard rectangular shapes. A variety of block shapes are available, allowing for a more nuanced and tailored representation of different types of information or entities. This section outlines the different block shapes you can use in Mermaid and their specific applications.\nStandard and Special Block Shapes ​\nMermaid supports a range of block shapes to suit different diagramming needs, from basic geometric shapes to more specialized forms.\nExample - Round Edged Block ​\nTo create a block with round edges, which can be used to represent a softer or more flexible component:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1(\"This is the text in the box\") \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Stadium-Shaped Block ​\nA stadium-shaped block, resembling an elongated circle, can be used for components that are process-oriented:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1([\"This is the text in the box\"]) \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Subroutine Shape ​\nFor representing subroutines or contained processes, a block with double vertical lines is useful:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1[[\"This is the text in the box\"]] \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Cylindrical Shape ​\nThe cylindrical shape is ideal for representing databases or storage components:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1[(\"Database\")] \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Circle Shape ​\nA circle can be used for centralized or pivotal components:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1((\"This is the text in the circle\")) \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Asymmetric, Rhombus, and Hexagon Shapes ​\nFor decision points, use a rhombus, and for unique or specialized processes, asymmetric and hexagon shapes can be utilized:\nAsymmetric\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1>\"This is the text in the box\"] \nCtrl + Enter|\nRhombus\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1{\"This is the text in the box\"} \nCtrl + Enter|\nHexagon\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1{{\"This is the text in the box\"}} \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Parallelogram and Trapezoid Shapes ​\nParallelogram and trapezoid shapes are perfect for inputs/outputs and transitional processes:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1[/\"This is the text in the box\"/] id2[\\\"This is the text in the box\"\\] A[/\"Christmas\"\\] B[\\\"Go shopping\"/] \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Double Circle ​\nFor highlighting critical or high-priority components, a double circle can be effective:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1(((\"This is the text in the circle\"))) \nCtrl + Enter|\nBlock Arrows and Space Blocks ​\nMermaid also offers unique shapes like block arrows and space blocks for directional flow and spacing.\nExample - Block Arrows ​\nBlock arrows can visually indicate direction or flow within a process:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta blockArrowId<[\"Label\"]>(right) blockArrowId2<[\"Label\"]>(left) blockArrowId3<[\"Label\"]>(up) blockArrowId4<[\"Label\"]>(down) blockArrowId5<[\"Label\"]>(x) blockArrowId6<[\"Label\"]>(y) blockArrowId6<[\"Label\"]>(x, down) \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Space Blocks ​\nSpace blocks can be used to create intentional empty spaces in the diagram, which is useful for layout and readability:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta columns 3 a space b c d e \nCtrl + Enter|\nor\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta ida space:3 idb idc \nCtrl + Enter|\nNote that you can set how many columns the space block occupied using the number notation space:num where num is a number indicating the num columns width. You can also use space which defaults to one column.\nThe variety of shapes and special blocks in Mermaid enhances the expressive power of block diagrams, allowing for more accurate and context-specific representations. These options give users the flexibility to create diagrams that are both informative and visually appealing. In the next sections, we will explore the ways to connect these blocks and customize their appearance.\nStandard and Special Block Shapes ​\nDiscuss the various shapes available for blocks, including standard shapes and special forms like block arrows and space blocks.\n5. Connecting Blocks with Edges ​\nOne of the key features of block diagrams in Mermaid is the ability to connect blocks using various types of edges or links. This section explores the different ways blocks can be interconnected to represent relationships and flows between components.\nBasic Linking and Arrow Types ​\nThe most fundamental aspect of connecting blocks is the use of arrows or links. These connectors depict the relationships or the flow of information between the blocks. Mermaid offers a range of arrow types to suit different diagramming needs.\nExample - Basic Links\nA simple link with an arrow can be created to show direction or flow from one block to another:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta A space B A-->B \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis example illustrates a direct connection from block 'A' to block 'B', using a straightforward arrow.\nThis syntax creates a line connecting 'A' and 'B', implying a relationship or connection without indicating a specific direction.\nText on Links ​\nIn addition to connecting blocks, it's often necessary to describe or label the relationship. Mermaid allows for the inclusion of text on links, providing context to the connections.\nExample - Text with Links To add text to a link, the syntax includes the text within the link definition:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta A space:2 B A-- \"X\" -->B \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis example show how to add descriptive text to the links, enhancing the information conveyed by the diagram.\nExample - Edges and Styles:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta columns 1 db((\"DB\")) blockArrowId6<[\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"]>(down) block:ID A B[\"A wide one in the middle\"] C end space D ID --> D C --> D style B fill:#939,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px \nCtrl + Enter|\n6. Styling and Customization ​\nBeyond the structure and layout of block diagrams, Mermaid offers extensive styling options. These customization features allow for the creation of more visually distinctive and informative diagrams. This section covers how to apply individual styles to blocks and how to use classes for consistent styling across multiple elements.\nIndividual Block Styling ​\nMermaid enables detailed styling of individual blocks, allowing you to apply various CSS properties such as color, stroke, and border thickness. This feature is especially useful for highlighting specific parts of a diagram or for adhering to certain visual themes.\nExample - Styling a Single Block ​\nTo apply custom styles to a block, you can use the style keyword followed by the block identifier and the desired CSS properties:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta id1 space id2 id1(\"Start\")-->id2(\"Stop\") style id1 fill:#636,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style id2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5 \nCtrl + Enter|\nIn this example, a class named 'blue' is defined and applied to block 'A', while block 'B' receives individual styling. This demonstrates the flexibility of Mermaid in applying both shared and unique styles within the same diagram.\nThe ability to style blocks individually or through classes provides a powerful tool for enhancing the visual impact and clarity of block diagrams. Whether emphasizing certain elements or maintaining a cohesive design across the diagram, these styling capabilities are central to effective diagramming. The next sections will present practical examples and use cases, followed by tips for troubleshooting common issues.\n7. Practical Examples and Use Cases ​\nThe versatility of Mermaid's block diagrams becomes evident when applied to real-world scenarios. This section provides practical examples demonstrating the application of various features discussed in previous sections. These examples showcase how block diagrams can be used to represent complex systems and processes in an accessible and informative manner.\nDetailed Examples Illustrating Various Features ​\nCombining the elements of structure, linking, and styling, we can create comprehensive diagrams that serve specific purposes in different contexts.\nExample - System Architecture ​\nIllustrating a simple software system architecture with interconnected components:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta columns 3 Frontend blockArrowId6<[\" \"]>(right) Backend space:2 down<[\" \"]>(down) Disk left<[\" \"]>(left) Database[(\"Database\")] classDef front fill:#696,stroke:#333; classDef back fill:#969,stroke:#333; class Frontend front class Backend,Database back \nCtrl + Enter|\nThis example shows a basic architecture with a frontend, backend, and database. The blocks are styled to differentiate between types of components.\nExample - Business Process Flow ​\nRepresenting a business process flow with decision points and multiple stages:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta columns 3 Start((\"Start\")) space:2 down<[\" \"]>(down) space:2 Decision{{\"Make Decision\"}} right<[\"Yes\"]>(right) Process1[\"Process A\"] downAgain<[\"No\"]>(down) space r3<[\"Done\"]>(down) Process2[\"Process B\"] r2<[\"Done\"]>(right) End((\"End\")) style Start fill:#969; style End fill:#696; \nCtrl + Enter|\nThese practical examples and scenarios underscore the utility of Mermaid block diagrams in simplifying and effectively communicating complex information across various domains.\nThe next section, 'Troubleshooting and Common Issues', will provide insights into resolving common challenges encountered when working with Mermaid block diagrams, ensuring a smooth diagramming experience.\n8. Troubleshooting and Common Issues ​\nWorking with Mermaid block diagrams can sometimes present challenges, especially as the complexity of the diagrams increases. This section aims to provide guidance on resolving common issues and offers tips for managing more intricate diagram structures.\nCommon Syntax Errors ​\nUnderstanding and avoiding common syntax errors is key to a smooth experience with Mermaid diagrams.\nExample - Incorrect Linking ​\nA common mistake is incorrect linking syntax, which can lead to unexpected results or broken diagrams:\nCorrection: Ensure that links between blocks are correctly specified with arrows (--> or ---) to define the direction and type of connection. Also remember that one of the fundaments for block diagram is to give the author full control of where the boxes are positioned so in the example you need to add a space between the boxes:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta A space B A --> B \nCtrl + Enter|\nExample - Misplaced Styling ​\nApplying styles in the wrong context or with incorrect syntax can lead to blocks not being styled as intended:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta A style A fill#969; \nCtrl + Enter|\nCorrection: Correct the syntax by ensuring proper separation of style properties with commas and using the correct CSS property format:\nCode:\nmermaid\nblock-beta A style A fill:#969,stroke:#333; \nCtrl + Enter|\nTips for Complex Diagram Structures ​\nManaging complexity in Mermaid diagrams involves planning and employing best practices.\nModular Design ​\nBreak down complex diagrams into smaller, more manageable components. This approach not only makes the diagram easier to understand but also simplifies the creation and maintenance process.\nConsistent Styling ​\nUse classes to maintain consistent styling across similar elements. This not only saves time but also ensures a cohesive and professional appearance.\nComments and Documentation ​\nUse comments with %% within the Mermaid syntax to document the purpose of various parts of the diagram. This practice is invaluable for maintaining clarity, especially when working in teams or returning to a diagram after some time.\nWith these troubleshooting tips and best practices, you can effectively manage and resolve common issues in Mermaid block diagrams. The final section, 'Conclusion', will summarize the key points covered in this documentation and invite user feedback for continuous improvement.",

    "page_content": "ZenUML | Mermaid\nA Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.\nMermaid can render sequence diagrams with ZenUML. Note that ZenUML uses a different syntax than the original Sequence Diagram in mermaid.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml title Demo Alice->John: Hello John, how are you? John->Alice: Great! Alice->John: See you later! \nCtrl + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nParticipants ​\nThe participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are rendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a different order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of appearance by doing the following:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml title Declare participant (optional) Bob Alice Alice->Bob: Hi Bob Bob->Alice: Hi Alice \nCtrl + Enter|\nAnnotators ​\nIf you specifically want to use symbols instead of just rectangles with text you can do so by using the annotator syntax to declare participants as per below.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml title Annotators @Actor Alice @Database Bob Alice->Bob: Hi Bob Bob->Alice: Hi Alice \nCtrl + Enter|\nHere are the available annotators: \nAliases ​\nThe participants can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml title Aliases A as Alice J as John A->J: Hello John, how are you? J->A: Great! \nCtrl + Enter|\nMessages ​\nMessages can be one of:\nSync message\nAsync message\nCreation message\nReply message\nSync message ​\nYou can think of a sync (blocking) method in a programming language.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml title Sync message A.SyncMessage A.SyncMessage(with, parameters) { B.nestedSyncMessage() } \nCtrl + Enter|\nAsync message ​\nYou can think of an async (non-blocking) method in a programming language. Fire an event and forget about it.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml title Async message Alice->Bob: How are you? \nCtrl + Enter|\nCreation message ​\nWe use new keyword to create an object.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml new A1 new A2(with, parameters) \nCtrl + Enter|\nReply message ​\nThere are three ways to express a reply message:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml // 1. assign a variable from a sync message. a = A.SyncMessage() // 1.1. optionally give the variable a type SomeType a = A.SyncMessage() // 2. use return keyword A.SyncMessage() { return result } // 3. use @return or @reply annotator on an async message @return A->B: result \nCtrl + Enter|\nThe third way @return is rarely used, but it is useful when you want to return to one level up.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml title Reply message Client->A.method() { B.method() { if(condition) { return x1 // return early @return A->Client: x11 } } return x2 } \nCtrl + Enter|\nNesting ​\nSync messages and Creation messages are naturally nestable with {}.\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml A.method() { B.nested_sync_method() B->C: nested async message } \nCtrl + Enter|\nIt is possible to add comments to a sequence diagram with // comment syntax. Comments will be rendered above the messages or fragments. Comments on other places are ignored. Markdown is supported.\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml // a comment on a participant will not be rendered BookService // a comment on a message. // **Markdown** is supported. BookService.getBook() \nCtrl + Enter|\nLoops ​\nIt is possible to express loops in a ZenUML diagram. This is done by any of the following notations:\nwhile\nfor\nforEach, foreach\nloop\nzenuml\nwhile(condition) { ...statements... }\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml Alice->John: Hello John, how are you? while(true) { John->Alice: Great! } \nCtrl + Enter|\nAlt ​\nIt is possible to express alternative paths in a sequence diagram. This is done by the notation\nzenuml\nif(condition1) { ...statements... } else if(condition2) { ...statements... } else { ...statements... }\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? if(is_sick) { Bob->Alice: Not so good :( } else { Bob->Alice: Feeling fresh like a daisy } \nCtrl + Enter|\nOpt ​\nIt is possible to render an opt fragment. This is done by the notation\nzenuml\nopt { ...statements... }\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? Bob->Alice: Not so good :( opt { Bob->Alice: Thanks for asking } \nCtrl + Enter|\nParallel ​\nIt is possible to show actions that are happening in parallel.\nThis is done by the notation\nzenuml\npar { statement1 statement2 statement3 }\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml par { Alice->Bob: Hello guys! Alice->John: Hello guys! } \nCtrl + Enter|\nTry/Catch/Finally (Break) ​\nIt is possible to indicate a stop of the sequence within the flow (usually used to model exceptions).\nThis is done by the notation\ntry { ...statements... } catch { ...statements... } finally { ...statements... }\nSee the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nzenuml try { Consumer->API: Book something API->BookingService: Start booking process } catch { API->Consumer: show failure } finally { API->BookingService: rollback status } \nCtrl + Enter|\nIntegrating with your library/website. ​\nZenuml uses the experimental lazy loading & async rendering features which could change in the future.\nYou can use this method to add mermaid including the zenuml diagram to a web page:\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; import zenuml from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mermaid-js/mermaid-zenuml@0.1.0/dist/mermaid-zenuml.esm.min.mjs'; await mermaid.registerExternalDiagrams([zenuml]); </script>",

    "page_content": "Architecture Diagrams Documentation (v11.1.0+) | Mermaid\nIn the context of mermaid-js, the architecture diagram is used to show the relationship between services and resources commonly found within the Cloud or CI/CD deployments. In an architecture diagram, services (nodes) are connected by edges. Related services can be placed within groups to better illustrate how they are organized.\nExample ​\nCode:\nmermaid\narchitecture-beta group api(cloud)[API] service db(database)[Database] in api service disk1(disk)[Storage] in api service disk2(disk)[Storage] in api service server(server)[Server] in api db:L -- R:server disk1:T -- B:server disk2:T -- B:db \n⌘ + Enter|\nSyntax ​\nThe building blocks of an architecture are groups, services, edges, and junctions.\nFor supporting components, icons are declared by surrounding the icon name with (), while labels are declared by surrounding the text with [].\nTo begin an architecture diagram, use the keyword architecture-beta, followed by your groups, services, edges, and junctions. While each of the 3 building blocks can be declared in any order, care must be taken to ensure the identifier was previously declared by another component.\nGroups ​\nThe syntax for declaring a group is:\ngroup {group id}({icon name})[{title}] (in {parent id})?\nPut together:\ngroup public_api(cloud)[Public API]\ncreates a group identified as public_api, uses the icon cloud, and has the label Public API.\nAdditionally, groups can be placed within a group using the optional in keyword\ngroup private_api(cloud)[Private API] in public_api\nServices ​\nThe syntax for declaring a service is:\nservice {service id}({icon name})[{title}] (in {parent id})?\nPut together:\nservice database(db)[Database]\ncreates the service identified as database, using the icon db, with the label Database.\nIf the service belongs to a group, it can be placed inside it through the optional in keyword\nservice database(db)[Database] in private_api\nEdges ​\nThe syntax for declaring an edge is:\n{serviceId}{{group}}?:{T|B|L|R} {<}?--{>}? {T|B|L|R}:{serviceId}{{group}}?\nEdge Direction ​\nThe side of the service the edge comes out of is specified by adding a colon (:) to the side of the service connecting to the arrow and adding L|R|T|B\nFor example:\ncreates an edge between the services db and server, with the edge coming out of the right of db and the left of server.\ncreates a 90 degree edge between the services db and server, with the edge coming out of the top of db and the left of server.\nArrows ​\nArrows can be added to each side of an edge by adding < before the direction on the left, and/or > after the direction on the right.\nFor example:\ncreates an edge with the arrow going into the gateway service\nEdges out of Groups ​\nTo have an edge go from a group to another group or service within another group, the {group} modifier can be added after the serviceId.\nFor example:\nservice server[Server] in groupOne service subnet[Subnet] in groupTwo server{group}:B --> T:subnet{group}\ncreates an edge going out of groupOne, adjacent to server, and into groupTwo, adjacent to subnet.\nIt's important to note that groupIds cannot be used for specifying edges and the {group} modifier can only be used for services within a group.\nJunctions ​\nJunctions are a special type of node which acts as a potential 4-way split between edges.\nThe syntax for declaring a junction is:\njunction {junction id} (in {parent id})?\nCode:\nmermaid\narchitecture-beta service left_disk(disk)[Disk] service top_disk(disk)[Disk] service bottom_disk(disk)[Disk] service top_gateway(internet)[Gateway] service bottom_gateway(internet)[Gateway] junction junctionCenter junction junctionRight left_disk:R -- L:junctionCenter top_disk:B -- T:junctionCenter bottom_disk:T -- B:junctionCenter junctionCenter:R -- L:junctionRight top_gateway:B -- T:junctionRight bottom_gateway:T -- B:junctionRight \n⌘ + Enter|\nIcons ​\nBy default, architecture diagram supports the following icons: cloud, database, disk, internet, server. Users can use any of the 200,000+ icons available in iconify.design, or add their own custom icons, by following the steps below.\nThe icon packs available can be found at icones.js.org. We use the name defined when registering the icon pack, to override the prefix field of the iconify pack. This allows the user to use shorter names for the icons. It also allows us to load a particular pack only when it is used in a diagram.\nUsing JSON file directly from CDN:\njs\nimport mermaid from 'CDN/mermaid.esm.mjs'; mermaid.registerIconPacks([ { name: 'logos', loader: () => fetch('https://unpkg.com/@iconify-json/logos/icons.json').then((res) => res.json()), }, ]);\nUsing packages and a bundler:\nbash\nnpm install @iconify-json/logos\nWith lazy loading\njs\nimport mermaid from 'mermaid'; mermaid.registerIconPacks([ { name: 'logos', loader: () => import('@iconify-json/logos').then((module) => module.icons), }, ]);\nWithout lazy loading\njs\nimport mermaid from 'mermaid'; import { icons } from '@iconify-json/logos'; mermaid.registerIconPacks([ { name: icons.prefix, // To use the prefix defined in the icon pack icons, }, ]);\nAfter the icons are installed, they can be used in the architecture diagram by using the format \"name:icon-name\", where name is the value used when registering the icon pack.\nCode:\nmermaid\narchitecture-beta group api(logos:aws-lambda)[API] service db(logos:aws-aurora)[Database] in api service disk1(logos:aws-glacier)[Storage] in api service disk2(logos:aws-s3)[Storage] in api service server(logos:aws-ec2)[Server] in api db:L -- R:server disk1:T -- B:server disk2:T -- B:db \n⌘ + Enter|",

    "page_content": "Usage | Mermaid\nMermaid is a JavaScript tool that makes use of a Markdown based syntax to render customizable diagrams, charts and visualizations.\nDiagrams can be re-rendered/modified by modifying their descriptions.\nCDN ​\nhttps://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/mermaid\nPlease note that you can switch versions through the dropdown box at the top right.\nUsing mermaid ​\nFor the majority of users, Using the Live Editor would be sufficient, however you may also opt to deploy mermaid as a dependency or using the Mermaid API.\nWe have compiled some Video Tutorials on how to use the Mermaid Live Editor.\nInstalling and Hosting Mermaid on a Webpage ​\nUsing the npm package:\nRequirements:\nNode >= 16\nbash\n# NPM npm install mermaid # Yarn yarn add mermaid # PNPM pnpm add mermaid\nHosting mermaid on a web page:\nNote: This topic is explored in greater depth in the User Guide for Beginners\nThe easiest way to integrate mermaid on a web page requires two elements:\nA graph definition, inside <pre> tags labeled class=mermaid.\nExample:\nhtml\n<pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph LR A --- B B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner); </pre>\nThe mermaid js script. Added using a script tag as an ESM import.\nExample:\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; </script>\nFollowing these directions, mermaid starts at page load and (when the page has loaded) it will locate the graph definitions inside the pre tags with class=\"mermaid\" and return diagrams in SVG form, following given definitions.\nSimple full example: ​\nhtml\n<!doctype html> <html lang=\"en\"> <body> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph LR A --- B B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner); </pre> <script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; </script> </body> </html>\nNotes: ​\nAn id attribute is also added to mermaid tags without one.\nMermaid can load multiple diagrams, in the same page.\nTry it out, save this code as HTML and load it using any browser. (Except Internet Explorer, please don't use Internet Explorer.)\nA securityLevel configuration has to first be cleared. securityLevel sets the level of trust for the parsed diagrams and limits click functionality. This was introduced in version 8.2 as a security improvement, aimed at preventing malicious use.\nIt is the site owner's responsibility to discriminate between trustworthy and untrustworthy user-bases and we encourage the use of discretion.\nsecurityLevel ​\nParameterDescriptionTypeRequiredValues\nsecurityLevel\tLevel of trust for parsed diagram\tString\tOptional\t'sandbox', 'strict', 'loose', 'antiscript'\t\nValues:\nstrict: (default) HTML tags in the text are encoded and click functionality is disabled.\nantiscript: HTML tags in text are allowed (only script elements are removed) and click functionality is enabled.\nloose: HTML tags in text are allowed and click functionality is enabled.\nsandbox: With this security level, all rendering takes place in a sandboxed iframe. This prevents any JavaScript from running in the context. This may hinder interactive functionality of the diagram, like scripts, popups in the sequence diagram, links to other tabs or targets, etc.\nINFO\nThis changes the default behaviour of mermaid so that after upgrade to 8.2, unless the securityLevel is not changed, tags in flowcharts are encoded as tags and clicking is disabled. sandbox security level is still in the beta version.\nIf you are taking responsibility for the diagram source security you can set the securityLevel to a value of your choosing. This allows clicks and tags are allowed.\nTo change securityLevel, you have to call mermaid.initialize:\njavascript\nmermaid.initialize({ securityLevel: 'loose', });\nLabels out of bounds ​\nIf you use dynamically loaded fonts that are loaded through CSS, such as fonts, mermaid should wait for the whole page to load (dom + assets, particularly the fonts file).\njavascript\n$(document).ready(function () { mermaid.initialize(); });\nNot doing so will most likely result in mermaid rendering graphs that have labels out of bounds. The default integration in mermaid uses the window.load event to start rendering.\nIf your page has other fonts in its body those might be used instead of the mermaid font. Specifying the font in your styling is a workaround for this.\ncss\npre.mermaid { font-family: 'trebuchet ms', verdana, arial; }\nUsing mermaid.run ​\nmermaid.run was added in v10 and is the preferred way of handling more complex integration. By default, mermaid.run will be called when the document is ready, rendering all elements with class=\"mermaid\".\nYou can customize that behavior by calling await mermaid.run(<config>).\nmermaid.initialize({startOnLoad: false}) will prevent mermaid.run from being called automatically after load.\nRender all elements with querySelector \".someOtherClass\"\njs\nmermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); await mermaid.run({ querySelector: '.someOtherClass', });\nRender all elements passed as an array\njs\nmermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); await mermaid.run({ nodes: [document.getElementById('someId'), document.getElementById('anotherId')], }); await mermaid.run({ nodes: document.querySelectorAll('.yetAnotherClass'), });\nRender all .mermaid elements while suppressing any error\njs\nmermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); await mermaid.run({ suppressErrors: true, });\nCalling mermaid.init - Deprecated ​\nWARNING\nmermaid.init is deprecated in v10 and will be removed in a future release. Please use mermaid.run instead.\nBy default, mermaid.init will be called when the document is ready, finding all elements with class=\"mermaid\". If you are adding content after mermaid is loaded, or otherwise need finer-grained control of this behavior, you can call init yourself with:\na configuration object\nsome nodes, as \na node\nan array-like of nodes\nor W3C selector that will find your nodes\nExample:\njavascript\nmermaid.init({ noteMargin: 10 }, '.someOtherClass');\nOr with no config object, and a jQuery selection:\njavascript\nmermaid.init(undefined, $('#someId .yetAnotherClass'));\nUsage with webpack ​\nmermaid fully supports webpack. Here is a working demo.\nAPI usage ​\nThe main idea of the API is to be able to call a render function with the graph definition as a string. The render function will render the graph and call a callback with the resulting SVG code. With this approach it is up to the site creator to fetch the graph definition from the site (perhaps from a textarea), render it and place the graph somewhere in the site.\nThe example below shows an example of how this could be used. The example just logs the resulting SVG to the JavaScript console.\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from './mermaid.esm.mjs'; mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); // Example of using the render function const drawDiagram = async function () { element = document.querySelector('#graphDiv'); const graphDefinition = 'graph TB\\na-->b'; const { svg } = await mermaid.render('graphDiv', graphDefinition); element.innerHTML = svg; }; await drawDiagram(); </script>\nTo determine the type of diagram present in a given text, you can utilize the mermaid.detectType function, as demonstrated in the example below.\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from './mermaid.esm.mjs'; const graphDefinition = `sequenceDiagram Pumbaa->>Timon:I ate like a pig. Timon->>Pumbaa:Pumbaa, you ARE a pig.`; try { const type = mermaid.detectType(graphDefinition); console.log(type); // 'sequence' } catch (error) { // UnknownDiagramError } </script>\nBinding events ​\nSometimes the generated graph also has defined interactions like tooltip and click events. When using the API one must add those events after the graph has been inserted into the DOM.\nThe example code below is an extract of what mermaid does when using the API. The example shows how it is possible to bind events to an SVG when using the API for rendering.\njavascript\n// Example of using the bindFunctions const drawDiagram = async function () { element = document.querySelector('#graphDiv'); const graphDefinition = 'graph TB\\na-->b'; const { svg, bindFunctions } = await mermaid.render('graphDiv', graphDefinition); element.innerHTML = svg; // This can also be written as `bindFunctions?.(element);` using the `?` shorthand. if (bindFunctions) { bindFunctions(element); } };\nThe graph is generated using the render call.\nAfter generation the render function calls the provided callback function, in this case it's called insertSvg.\nThe callback function is called with two parameters, the SVG code of the generated graph and a function. This function binds events to the SVG after it is inserted into the DOM.\nInsert the SVG code into the DOM for presentation.\nCall the binding function that binds the events.\nExample of a marked renderer ​\nThis is the renderer used for transforming the documentation from Markdown to html with mermaid diagrams in the html.\njavascript\nconst renderer = new marked.Renderer(); renderer.code = function (code, language) { if (code.match(/^sequenceDiagram/) || code.match(/^graph/)) { return '<pre class=\"mermaid\">' + code + '</pre>'; } else { return '<pre><code>' + code + '</code></pre>'; } };\nAnother example in CoffeeScript that also includes the mermaid script tag in the generated markup.\ncoffee\nmarked = require 'marked' module.exports = (options) -> hasMermaid = false renderer = new marked.Renderer() renderer.defaultCode = renderer.code renderer.code = (code, language) -> if language is 'mermaid' html = '' if not hasMermaid hasMermaid = true html += '<script src=\"'+options.mermaidPath+'\"></script>' html + '<pre class=\"mermaid\">'+code+'</pre>' else @defaultCode(code, language) renderer\nAdvanced usage ​\nSyntax validation without rendering ​\nThe mermaid.parse(text, parseOptions) function validates graph definitions without rendering a graph.\nThe function mermaid.parse(text, parseOptions), takes a text string as an argument and returns { diagramType: string } if the definition follows mermaid's syntax.\nIf the definition is invalid, the function returns false if parseOptions.suppressErrors is set to true. Otherwise, it throws an error.\nThe parseError function will be called when the parse function throws an error. It will not be called if parseOptions.suppressErrors is set to true.\nIt is possible to override this function in order to handle the error in an application-specific way.\nThe code-example below in meta code illustrates how this could work:\njavascript\nmermaid.parseError = function (err, hash) { displayErrorInGui(err); }; const textFieldUpdated = async function () { const textStr = getTextFromFormField('code'); if (await mermaid.parse(textStr)) { reRender(textStr); } }; bindEventHandler('change', 'code', textFieldUpdated);\nConfiguration ​\nYou can pass the required configuration to the mermaid.initialize call. This is the preferred way of configuring mermaid. The list of configuration objects are described in the mermaidAPI documentation.\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from './mermaid.esm.mjs'; let config = { startOnLoad: true, flowchart: { useMaxWidth: false, htmlLabels: true } }; mermaid.initialize(config); </script>\nINFO\nThis is the preferred way of configuring mermaid.\nThe following methods are deprecated and are kept only for backwards compatibility. ​\nUsing the mermaid object ​\nIt is possible to set some configuration via the mermaid object. The two parameters that are supported using this approach are:\nmermaid.startOnLoad\nmermaid.htmlLabels\njavascript\nmermaid.startOnLoad = true;\nWARNING\nThis way of setting the configuration is deprecated. Instead the preferred way is to use the initialize method. This functionality is only kept for backwards compatibility.",

    "page_content": "Theme Configuration | Mermaid\nDynamic and integrated theme configuration was introduced in Mermaid version 8.7.0.\nThemes can now be customized at the site-wide level, or on individual Mermaid diagrams. For site-wide theme customization, the initialize call is used. For diagram specific customization, the init directive is used.\nAvailable Themes ​\ndefault - This is the default theme for all diagrams.\nneutral - This theme is great for black and white documents that will be printed.\ndark - This theme goes well with dark-colored elements or dark-mode.\nforest - This theme contains shades of green.\nbase - This is the only theme that can be modified. Use this theme as the base for customizations.\nSite-wide Theme ​\nTo customize themes site-wide, call the initialize method on the mermaid.\nExample of initialize call setting theme to base:\njavascript\nmermaid.initialize({ securityLevel: 'loose', theme: 'base', });\nDiagram-specific Themes ​\nTo customize the theme of an individual diagram, use the init directive.\nExample of init directive setting the theme to forest:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: {'theme':'forest'}}%% graph TD a --> b \n⌘ + Enter|\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: {'theme':'forest'}}%% graph TD a --> b \n⌘ + Enter|\nReminder: the only theme that can be customized is the base theme. The following section covers how to use themeVariables for customizations.\nCustomizing Themes with themeVariables ​\nTo make a custom theme, modify themeVariables via init.\nYou will need to use the base theme as it is the only modifiable theme.\nParameterDescriptionTypeProperties\nthemeVariables\tModifiable with the init directive\tObject\tprimaryColor, primaryTextColor, lineColor (see full list)\t\nExample of modifying themeVariables using the init directive:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{ init: { 'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#BB2528', 'primaryTextColor': '#fff', 'primaryBorderColor': '#7C0000', 'lineColor': '#F8B229', 'secondaryColor': '#006100', 'tertiaryColor': '#fff' } } }%% graph TD A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping) B --> C{Let me think} B --> G[/Another/] C ==>|One| D[Laptop] C -->|Two| E[iPhone] C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car] subgraph section C D E F G end \n⌘ + Enter|\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{ init: { 'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#BB2528', 'primaryTextColor': '#fff', 'primaryBorderColor': '#7C0000', 'lineColor': '#F8B229', 'secondaryColor': '#006100', 'tertiaryColor': '#fff' } } }%% graph TD A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping) B --> C{Let me think} B --> G[/Another/] C ==>|One| D[Laptop] C -->|Two| E[iPhone] C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car] subgraph section C D E F G end \n⌘ + Enter|\nColor and Color Calculation ​\nTo ensure diagram readability, the default value of certain variables is calculated or derived from other variables. For example, primaryBorderColor is derived from the primaryColor variable. So if the primaryColor variable is customized, Mermaid will adjust primaryBorderColor automatically. Adjustments can mean a color inversion, a hue change, a darkening/lightening by 10%, etc.\nThe theming engine will only recognize hex colors and not color names. So, the value #ff0000 will work, but red will not.\nTheme Variables ​\nVariableDefault valueDescription\ndarkMode\tfalse\tAffects how derived colors are calculated.

    "page_content": "Directives | Mermaid\nWARNING\nDirectives are deprecated from v10.5.0. Please use the config key in frontmatter to pass configuration. See Configuration for more details.\nDirectives ​\nDirectives give a diagram author the capability to alter the appearance of a diagram before rendering by changing the applied configuration.\nThe significance of having directives is that you have them available while writing the diagram, and can modify the default global and diagram-specific configurations. So, directives are applied on top of the default configuration. The beauty of directives is that you can use them to alter configuration settings for a specific diagram, i.e. at an individual level.\nWhile directives allow you to change most of the default configuration settings, there are some that are not available, for security reasons. Also, you have the option to define the set of configurations that you wish to allow diagram authors to override with directives.\nTypes of Directives options ​\nMermaid basically supports two types of configuration options to be overridden by directives.\nGeneral/Top Level configurations : These are the configurations that are available and applied to all the diagram. Some of the most important top-level configurations are:\ntheme\nfontFamily\nlogLevel\nsecurityLevel\nstartOnLoad\nsecure\nDiagram-specific configurations : These are the configurations that are available and applied to a specific diagram. For each diagram there are specific configuration that will alter how that particular diagram looks and behaves. For example, mirrorActors is a configuration that is specific to the SequenceDiagram and alters whether the actors are mirrored or not. So this config is available only for the SequenceDiagram type.\nNOTE: Not all configuration options are listed here. To get hold of all the configuration options, please refer to the defaultConfig.ts in the source code.\nINFO\nWe plan to publish a complete list of top-level configurations & diagram-specific configurations with their possible values in the docs soon.\nDeclaring directives ​\nNow that we have defined the types of configurations that are available, we can learn how to declare directives. A directive always starts and ends with %% signs with directive text in between, like %% {directive_text} %%.\nHere the structure of a directive text is like a nested key-value pair map or a JSON object with root being init. Where all the general configurations are defined in the top level, and all the diagram specific configurations are defined one level deeper with diagram type as key/root for that section.\nThe following code snippet shows the structure of a directive:\n%%{ init: { \"theme\": \"dark\", \"fontFamily\": \"monospace\", \"logLevel\": \"info\", \"flowchart\": { \"htmlLabels\": true, \"curve\": \"linear\" }, \"sequence\": { \"mirrorActors\": true } } }%%\nYou can also define the directives in a single line, like this:\n%%{init: { **insert configuration options here** } }%%\nFor example, the following code snippet:\n%%{init: { \"sequence\": { \"mirrorActors\":false }}}%%\nNotes: The JSON object that is passed as {argument} must be valid key value pairs and encased in quotation marks or it will be ignored. Valid Key Value pairs can be found in config.\nExample with a simple graph:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark' } }%% graph LR A-->B \n⌘ + Enter|\nHere the directive declaration will set the logLevel to debug and the theme to dark for a rendered mermaid diagram, changing the appearance of the diagram itself.\nNote: You can use 'init' or 'initialize' as both are acceptable as init directives. Also note that %%init%% and %%initialize%% directives will be grouped together after they are parsed.\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'forest' } }%% %%{initialize: { 'logLevel': 'fatal', \"theme\":'dark', 'startOnLoad': true } }%% ... \n⌘ + Enter|\nFor example, parsing the above generates a single %%init%% JSON object below, combining the two directives and carrying over the last value given for loglevel:\njson\n{ \"logLevel\": \"fatal\", \"theme\": \"dark\", \"startOnLoad\": true }\nThis will then be sent to mermaid.initialize(...) for rendering.\nDirective Examples ​\nNow that the concept of directives has been explained, let us see some more examples of directive usage:\nChanging theme via directive ​\nThe following code snippet changes theme to forest:\n%%{init: { \"theme\": \"forest\" } }%%\nPossible theme values are: default, base, dark, forest and neutral. Default Value is default.\nExample:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { \"theme\": \"forest\" } }%% graph TD A(Forest) --> B[/Another/] A --> C[End] subgraph section B C end \n⌘ + Enter|\nChanging fontFamily via directive ​\nThe following code snippet changes fontFamily to Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif:\n%%{init: { \"fontFamily\": \"Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif\" } }%%\nExample:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { \"fontFamily\": \"Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif\" } }%% graph TD A(Forest) --> B[/Another/] A --> C[End] subgraph section B C end \n⌘ + Enter|\nChanging logLevel via directive ​\nThe following code snippet changes logLevel to 2:\n%%{init: { \"logLevel\": 2 } }%%\nPossible logLevel values are:\n1 for debug,\n2 for info\n3 for warn\n4 for error\n5 for only fatal errors\nDefault Value is 5.\nExample:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { \"logLevel\": 2 } }%% graph TD A(Forest) --> B[/Another/] A --> C[End] subgraph section B C end \n⌘ + Enter|\nChanging flowchart config via directive ​\nSome common flowchart configurations are:\nhtmlLabels: true/false\ncurve: linear/curve\ndiagramPadding: number\nuseMaxWidth: number\nFor a complete list of flowchart configurations, see defaultConfig.ts in the source code. Soon we plan to publish a complete list of all diagram-specific configurations updated in the docs.\nThe following code snippet changes flowchart config:\n%%{init: { \"flowchart\": { \"htmlLabels\": true, \"curve\": \"linear\" } } }%%\nHere we are overriding only the flowchart config, and not the general config, setting htmlLabels to true and curve to linear.\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { \"flowchart\": { \"htmlLabels\": true, \"curve\": \"linear\" } } }%% graph TD A(Forest) --> B[/Another/] A --> C[End] subgraph section B C end \n⌘ + Enter|\nChanging Sequence diagram config via directive ​\nSome common sequence diagram configurations are:\nwidth: number\nheight: number\nmessageAlign: left, center, right\nmirrorActors: boolean\nuseMaxWidth: boolean\nrightAngles: boolean\nshowSequenceNumbers: boolean\nwrap: boolean\nFor a complete list of sequence diagram configurations, see defaultConfig.ts in the source code. Soon we plan to publish a complete list of all diagram-specific configurations updated in the docs.\nSo, wrap by default has a value of false for sequence diagrams.\nLet us see an example:\nCode:\nmermaid\nsequenceDiagram Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? Bob->Alice: Fine, how did your mother like the book I suggested? And did you catch the new book about alien invasion? Alice->Bob: Good. Bob->Alice: Cool \n⌘ + Enter|\nNow let us enable wrap for sequence diagrams.\nThe following code snippet changes sequence diagram config for wrap to true:\n%%{init: { \"sequence\": { \"wrap\": true} } }%%\nBy applying that snippet to the diagram above, wrap will be enabled:\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: { \"sequence\": { \"wrap\": true, \"width\":300 } } }%% sequenceDiagram Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? Bob->Alice: Fine, how did your mother like the book I suggested? And did you catch the new book about alien invasion? Alice->Bob: Good. Bob->Alice: Cool \n⌘ + Enter|",

If you have users on unsupported browsers, legacyMathML can be set in the config to fall back to CSS rendering. Note that you must provide KaTeX's stylesheets on your own as they do not come bundled with Mermaid.\nExample with legacy mode enabled (the latest version of KaTeX's stylesheet can be found on their docs):\nhtml\n<!doctype html> <!-- KaTeX requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, KaTeX may not render properly --> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <!-- Please ensure the stylesheet's version matches with the KaTeX version in your package-lock --> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@{version_number}/dist/katex.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-{hash}\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" /> </head> <body> <script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from './mermaid.esm.mjs'; mermaid.initialize({ legacyMathML: true, }); </script> </body> </html>\nHandling Rendering Differences ​\nDue to differences between default fonts across operating systems and browser's MathML implementations, inconsistent results can be seen across platforms. If having consistent results are important, or the most optimal rendered results are desired, forceLegacyMathML can be enabled in the config.\nThis option will always use KaTeX's stylesheet instead of only when MathML is not supported (as with legacyMathML). Note that only forceLegacyMathML needs to be set.\nIf including KaTeX's stylesheet is not a concern, enabling this option is recommended to avoid scenarios where no MathML implementation within a browser provides the desired output (as seen below).",

Read more about Accessible Rich Internet Applications and the W3 standards.\nMermaid will automatically insert the aria-roledescription and, if provided in the diagram text by the diagram author, the accessible title and description.\naria-roledescription ​\nThe aria-roledescription for the SVG HTML element is set to the diagram type key. (Note this may be slightly different than the keyword used for the diagram in the diagram text.)\nFor example: The diagram type key for a state diagram is \"stateDiagram\". Here (a part of) the HTML of the SVG tag that shows the automatically inserted aria-roledescription set to \"stateDiagram\". (Note that some of the SVG attributes and the SVG contents are omitted for clarity.):\nhtml\n<svg aria-roledescription=\"stateDiagram\" class=\"statediagram\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100%\" id=\"mermaid-1668720491568\" ></svg>\nAccessible Title and Description ​\nSupport for accessible titles and descriptions is available for all diagrams/chart types. We have tried to keep the same keywords and format for all diagrams so that it is easy to understand and maintain.\nThe accessible title and description will add <title> and <desc> elements within the SVG element and the aria-labelledby and aria-describedby attributes in the SVG tag.\nHere is HTML that is generated, showing that the SVG element is labelled by the accessible title (id = chart-title-mermaid-1668725057758) and described by the accessible description (id = chart-desc-mermaid-1668725057758 ); and the accessible title element (text = \"This is the accessible title\") and the accessible description element (text = \"This is an accessible description\").\n(Note that some of the SVG attributes and the SVG contents are omitted for clarity.)\nhtml\n<svg aria-labelledby=\"chart-title-mermaid-1668725057758\" aria-describedby=\"chart-desc-mermaid-1668725057758\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100%\" id=\"mermaid-1668725057758\" > <title id=\"chart-title-mermaid-1668725057758\">This is the accessible title</title> <desc id=\"chart-desc-mermaid-1668725057758\">This is an accessible description</desc> </svg>\nDetails for the syntax follow.\naccessible title ​\nThe accessible title is specified with the accTitle keyword, followed by a colon (:), and the string value for the title. The string value ends at the end of the line. (It can only be a single line.)\nEx: accTitle: This is a single line title\nSee the accTitle and accDescr usage examples for how this can be used in a diagram and the resulting HTML generated.\naccessible description ​\nAn accessible description can be 1 line long (a single line) or many lines long.\nThe single line accessible description is specified with the accDescr keyword, followed by a colon (:), followed by the string value for the description.\nEx: accDescr: This is a single line description.\nA multiple line accessible description does not have a colon (:) after the accDescr keyword and is surrounded by curly brackets ({}).\nEx:\nmarkdown\naccDescr { This is a multiple line accessible description.

    "page_content": "Mermaid Contributing Guide | Mermaid\nYou decided to take part in the development? Welcome!\nWe are trying to make our guidelines for you as explicit and detailed as possible.\nInitial Setup ​\nInitial setup consists of 3 main steps:\nGet the Source Code ​\nIn GitHub, you first fork a mermaid repository when you are going to make changes and submit pull requests.\nThen you clone a copy to your local development machine (e.g. where you code) to make a copy with all the files to work with.\nbash\ngit clone git@github.com/your-fork/mermaid\nOnce you have cloned the repository onto your development machine, change into the mermaid project folder (the top level directory of the mermaid project repository)\nInstall Requirements ​\nWe support development within Docker environment along with host setup. You may choose it up to your preferences.\nHost\nThese are the tools we use for working with the code and documentation:\nNode.js.\npnpm package manager.\nThe following commands must be sufficient enough to start with:\nbash\ncurl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh - pnpm env use --global 20\nYou may also need to reload .shrc or .bashrc afterwards.\nDocker\nInstall Docker. And that is pretty much all you need.\nOptionally, to run GUI (Cypress) within Docker you will also need an X11 server installed. You might already have it installed, so check this by running:\nIf the $DISPLAY variable is not empty, then an X11 server is running. Otherwise you may need to install one.\nInstall Packages ​\nHost\nInstall packages:\nDocker\nFor development using Docker there is a self-documented run bash script, which provides convenient aliases for docker compose commands.\nMake sure that ./run script is executable:\nTIP\nTo get detailed help simply type ./run or ./run help.\nIt also has short Development quick start guide embedded.\nThen install packages:\nVerify Everything Works ​\nThis step is optional, but it helps to make sure that everything in development branch was OK before you started making any changes.\nYou can run the test script to verify that pnpm is working and that the repository has been cloned correctly:\nHost\nDocker\nThe test script and others are in the top-level package.json file.\nAll tests should run successfully without any errors or failures.\nINFO\nYou might see lint or formatting warnings. Those are ok during this step.\nWorkflow ​\nContributing process is very simple and straightforward:\nMermaid uses a Git Flow–inspired approach to branching.\nDevelopment is done in the develop branch.\nTo prepare a new version for release the maintainers create a release/vX.X.X branch from develop for testing. Once the release happens we add a tag to the release branch and merge it with master. The live product and on-line documentation are what is in the master branch.\nCheckout a New Branch ​\nTIP\nAll new work should be based on the develop branch.\nMake sure you have the most up-to-date version of the develop branch.\nCheck out the develop branch, then fetch or pull to update it:\nbash\ngit checkout develop git fetch # or `git pull`\nCreate a new branch for your work:\nbash\ngit checkout -b docs/2910_update-contributing-guidelines\nWe use the following naming convention for branches:\ntxt\n[feature | bug | chore | docs]/[issue number]_[short-description]\nYou can always check current configuration of labelling and branch prefixes\nThe first part is the type of change: a feature, bug, chore, docs\nfollowed by a slash (/),which helps to group like types together in many git tools\nfollowed by the issue number, e.g. 2910\nfollowed by an underscore (_)\nfollowed by a short description with dashes (-) or underscores (_) instead of spaces\nIf your work is specific to a single diagram type, it is a good idea to put the diagram type at the start of the description. This will help us keep release notes organized by a diagram type.\nINFO\nA new feature described in issue 2945 that adds a new arrow type called 'florbs' to state diagrams\nfeature/2945_state-diagram-new-arrow-florbs\nTIP\nA bug described in issue 1123 that causes random ugly red text in multiple diagram types\nbug/1123_fix_random_ugly_red_text\nContributing Code ​\nCode is the heart of every software project. We strive to make it better. Who if not us?\nWhere is the Code Located? ​\nThe core of Mermaid is located under packages/mermaid/src.\nRunning Mermaid Locally ​\nHost\nDocker\nAfter starting the dev server open http://localhost:9000 in your browser.\nNow you are ready to make your changes!\nMake Changes ​\nHave a look at http://localhost:9000. There is a list of demos that can be used to see and test your changes.\nIf you need a specific diagram, you can duplicate the example.html file in /demos/dev and add your own mermaid code to your copy.\nThat will be served at http://localhost:9000/dev/your-file-name.html. After making code changes, the dev server will rebuild the mermaid library and automatically reload the page.\nEdit files in packages/mermaid/src as required.\nWrite Tests ​\nTests ensure that each function, module, or part of code does what it says it will do. This is critically important when other changes are made to ensure that existing code is not broken (no regression).\nJust as important, the tests act as specifications: they specify what the code does (or should do). Whenever someone is new to a section of code, they should be able to read the tests to get a thorough understanding of what it does and why.\nIf you are fixing a bug, you should add tests to ensure that your code has actually fixed the bug, to specify/describe what the code is doing, and to ensure the bug doesn't happen again. (If there had been a test for the situation, the bug never would have happened in the first place.) You may need to change existing tests if they were inaccurate.\nIf you are adding a feature, you will definitely need to add tests. Depending on the size of your feature, you may need to add integration tests.\nUnit Tests ​\nUnit tests are tests that test a single function or module. They are the easiest to write and the fastest to run.\nUnit tests are mandatory for all code except the renderers. (The renderers are tested with integration tests.)\nWe use Vitest to run unit tests.\nHost\nYou can use the following command to run the unit tests:\nWhen writing new tests, it's easier to have the tests automatically run as you make changes. You can do this by running the following command:\nDocker\nWhen using Docker prepend your command with ./run:\nIntegration / End-to-End (E2E) Tests ​\nThese test the rendering and visual appearance of the diagrams.\nThis ensures that the rendering of that feature in the E2E will be reviewed in the release process going forward. Less chance that it breaks!\nTo start working with the E2E tests:\nHost\nRun pnpm dev to start the dev server\nStart Cypress by running pnpm cypress:open\nDocker\nEnable local connections for x11 server xhost +local:\nRun ./run pnpm dev to start the dev server\nStart Cypress by running ./run pnpm cypress:open --project .\nThe rendering tests are very straightforward to create. There is a function imgSnapshotTest, which takes a diagram in text form and the mermaid options, and it renders that diagram in Cypress.\nWhen running in CI it will take a snapshot of the rendered diagram and compare it with the snapshot from last build and flag it for review if it differs.\nThis is what a rendering test looks like:\njs\nit('should render forks and joins', () => { imgSnapshotTest( ` stateDiagram state fork_state &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt; [*] --> fork_state fork_state --> State2 fork_state --> State3 state join_state &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt; State2 --> join_state State3 --> join_state join_state --> State4 State4 --> [*] `, { logLevel: 0 } ); });\nUpdate Documentation ​\nTIP\nOur documentation is managed in packages/mermaid/src/docs. Details on how to edit is in the documentation section\nIf the users have no way to know that things have changed, then you haven't really fixed anything for the users; you've just added to making Mermaid feel broken. Likewise, if users don't know that there is a new feature that you've implemented, it will forever remain unknown and unused.\nThe documentation has to be updated for users to know that things have been changed and added! If you are adding a new feature, add (v<MERMAID_RELEASE_VERSION>+) in the title or description. It will be replaced automatically with the current version number when the release happens.\neg: # Feature Name (v<MERMAID_RELEASE_VERSION>+)\nWe know it can sometimes be hard to code and write user documentation.\nCreate another issue specifically for the documentation. You will need to help with the PR, but definitely ask for help if you feel stuck. When it feels hard to write stuff out, explaining it to someone and having that person ask you clarifying questions can often be 80% of the work!\nWhen in doubt, write up and submit what you can. It can be clarified and refined later. (With documentation, something is better than nothing!)\nContributing Documentation ​\nIf it is not in the documentation, it's like it never happened. Wouldn't that be sad? With all the effort that was put into the feature?\nWhere is the Documentation Located? ​\nWARNING\nDO NOT CHANGE FILES IN /docs\nThe docs folder will be automatically generated when committing to packages/mermaid/src/docs and should not be edited manually.\nDocumentation is located in the packages/mermaid/src/docs folder. Just pick the right section and start typing.\nThe contents of mermaid.js.org are based on the docs from the master branch. Updates committed to the master branch are reflected in the Mermaid Docs once published.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR classDef default fill:#fff,color:black,stroke:black source[\"Edit /packages/mermaid/src/docs\"] -- automatic processing--> published[\"View /docs which will be published on Official Website\"] \n⌘ + Enter|\nRunning the Documentation Website Locally ​\nThe mermaid documentation site is powered by Vitepress.\nStart development server for the documentation site\nHost\nbash\npnpm --filter mermaid run docs:dev\nor\nbash\ncd packages/mermaid pnpm docs:dev\nDocker\nOpen http://localhost:3333/ in your browser.\nFormatting ​\nThe documentation is written in Markdown. To get acquainted with its syntax see the GitHub Markdown help page.\nYou can use note, tip, warning and danger in triple backticks to add a note, tip, warning or danger box.\nDANGER\nDo not use vitepress specific markdown syntax ::: warning as it will not be processed correctly.\nHere are a few examples:\nmarkdown\n```note This is a note ``` ```tip This is a tip ``` ```warning This is a warning ``` ```danger This is a danger alert ```\nDANGER\nThis is a danger alert\nNavigation ​\nIf you want to propose changes to how the documentation is organized, such as adding a new section or re-arranging or renaming a section, you must update the sidebar navigation, which is defined in the vitepress config. The same goes to topbar.\nBuild Docs ​\nThe content of /docs folder is built with Github Actions.\nWARNING\nSo as to allow automatic compilation of documentation pages you have to enable Github Actions on your fork first\nSubmit your pull request ​\nINFO\nDo not forget to push your changes\nbash\ngit push -u origin docs/2910_update-guidelines\nWe make all changes via Pull Requests (PRs). Open a new one.\nRight now we are not following any strict rules about naming PRs. Give it a representative title and short description. There is also a pull request template which will help you with it.\nIn case in its description contains a magic comment your PR will be automatically attached to the issue:\nmarkdown\nResolves #<your issue ID here>\nCongratulations ​\nYou have successfully submitted your improvements! What is next?\nPRs will be reviewed by active maintainers, who will provide feedback and request changes as needed.\nThe maintainers will request a review from knsv, if necessary.\nOnce the PR is approved, the maintainers will merge the PR into the develop branch.\nWhen a release is ready, the release/x.x.x branch will be created, extensively tested and knsv will be in charge of the release process.\nThanks for you help!",

    "page_content": "Adding a New Diagram/Chart 📊\nExamples ​\nPlease refer to the following PRs on how to use Langium to add a new diagram grammar.\nhttps://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/pull/4839\nhttps://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/pull/4751\nWARNING\nThe below steps are a work in progress and will be updated soon.\nStep 1: Grammar & Parsing ​\nStep 2: Rendering ​\nWrite a renderer that given the data found during parsing renders the diagram. To look at an example look at sequenceRenderer.js rather than the flowchart renderer as this is a more generic example.\nPlace the renderer in the diagram folder.\nStep 3: Detection of the new diagram type ​\nThe second thing to do is to add the capability to detect the new diagram to type to the detectType in diagram-api/detectType.ts. The detection should return a key for the new diagram type. This key will be used to as the aria roledescription, so it should be a word that clearly describes the diagram type. For example, if your new diagram uses a UML deployment diagram, a good key would be \"UMLDeploymentDiagram\" because assistive technologies such as a screen reader would voice that as \"U-M-L Deployment diagram.\" Another good key would be \"deploymentDiagram\" because that would be voiced as \"Deployment Diagram.\" A bad key would be \"deployment\" because that would not sufficiently describe the diagram.\nNote that the diagram type key does not have to be the same as the diagram keyword chosen for the grammar, but it is helpful if they are the same.\nCommon parts of a diagram ​\nThere are a few features that are common between the different types of diagrams. We try to standardize the diagrams that work as similar as possible for the end user. The commonalities are:\nDirectives, a way of modifying the diagram configuration from within the diagram code.\nAccessibility, a way for an author to provide additional information like titles and descriptions to people accessing a text with diagrams using a screen reader.\nThemes, there is a common way to modify the styling of diagrams in Mermaid.\nComments should follow mermaid standards\nHere are some pointers on how to handle these different areas.\nAccessibility ​\nMermaid automatically adds the following accessibility information for the diagram SVG HTML element:\naria-roledescription\naccessible title\naccessible description\naria-roledescription ​\nThe aria-roledescription is automatically set to the diagram type and inserted into the SVG element.\nSee the definition of aria-roledescription in the Accessible Rich Internet Applications W3 standard.\naccessible title and description ​\nThe syntax for accessible titles and descriptions is described in the Accessibility documentation section.\nThe functions for setting title and description are provided by a common module. This is the import in flowDb.js:\nimport { setAccTitle, getAccTitle, getAccDescription, setAccDescription, clear as commonClear, } from '../../commonDb';\nThe accessibility title and description are inserted into the SVG element in the render function in mermaidAPI.\nTheming ​\nMermaid supports themes and has an integrated theming engine. You can read more about how the themes can be used in the docs.\nWhen adding themes to a diagram it comes down to a few important locations in the code.\nThe entry point for the styling engine is in src/styles.js. The getStyles function will be called by Mermaid when the styles are being applied to the diagram.\nThis function will in turn call a function your diagram should provide returning the css for the new diagram. The diagram specific, also which is commonly also called getStyles and located in the folder for your diagram under src/diagrams and should be named styles.js. The getStyles function will be called with the theme options as an argument like in the following example:\njs\nconst getStyles = (options) => ` .line { stroke-width: 1; stroke: ${options.lineColor}; stroke-dasharray: 2; } // ... `;\nNote that you need to provide your function to the main getStyles by adding it into the themes object in src/styles.js like in the xyzDiagram in the provided example:\njs\nconst themes = { flowchart, 'flowchart-v2': flowchart, sequence, xyzDiagram, //... };\nThe actual options and values for the colors are defined in src/theme/theme-[xyz].js. If you provide the options your diagram needs in the existing theme files then the theming will work smoothly without hiccups.",

This page describes how to report any vulnerabilities you may find, and lists best practices to minimize the risk of introducing a vulnerability.\nReporting vulnerabilities ​\nTo report a vulnerability, please e-mail security@mermaid.live with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.\nWe aim to reply within three working days, probably much sooner.\nYou should expect a close collaboration as we work to resolve the issue you have reported. Please reach out to security@mermaid.live again if you do not receive prompt attention and regular updates.\nYou may also reach out to the team via our public Discord chat channels; however, please make sure to e-mail security@mermaid.live when reporting an issue, and avoid revealing information about vulnerabilities in public as that could that could put users at risk.\nBest practices ​\nKeep current with the latest Mermaid releases. We regularly update Mermaid, and these updates may fix security defects discovered in previous versions. Check the Mermaid release notes for security-related updates.\nKeep your application’s dependencies up to date. Make sure you upgrade your package dependencies to keep the dependencies up to date. Avoid pinning to specific versions for your dependencies and, if you do, make sure you check periodically to see if your dependencies have had security updates, and update the pin accordingly.\nConfiguring DomPurify ​\nBy default Mermaid uses a baseline DOMPurify config. It is possible to override the options passed to DOMPurify by adding a dompurifyConfig key to the Mermaid options. This could potentially break the output of Mermaid so use this with caution.",

    "page_content": "Flowcharts Syntax | Mermaid\nFlowcharts are composed of nodes (geometric shapes) and edges (arrows or lines). The Mermaid code defines how nodes and edges are made and accommodates different arrow types, multi-directional arrows, and any linking to and from subgraphs.\nWARNING\nIf you are using the word \"end\" in a Flowchart node, capitalize the entire word or any of the letters (e.g., \"End\" or \"END\"), or apply this workaround. Typing \"end\" in all lowercase letters will break the Flowchart.\nWARNING\nIf you are using the letter \"o\" or \"x\" as the first letter in a connecting Flowchart node, add a space before the letter or capitalize the letter (e.g., \"dev--- ops\", \"dev---Ops\").\nTyping \"A---oB\" will create a circle edge.\nTyping \"A---xB\" will create a cross edge.\nA node (default) ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- title: Node --- flowchart LR id \n⌘ + Enter|\nINFO\nThe id is what is displayed in the box.\nTIP\nInstead of flowchart one can also use graph.\nA node with text ​\nIt is also possible to set text in the box that differs from the id. If this is done several times, it is the last text found for the node that will be used. Also if you define edges for the node later on, you can omit text definitions.

These new shapes provide more options to represent processes, decisions, events, data storage visually, and other elements within your flowcharts, improving clarity and semantic meaning.\nNew Syntax for Shape Definition\nMermaid now supports a general syntax for defining shape types to accommodate the growing number of shapes. This syntax allows you to assign specific shapes to nodes using a clear and flexible format:\nThis syntax creates a node A as a rectangle. It renders in the same way as A[\"A\"], or A.\nComplete List of New Shapes ​\nBelow is a comprehensive list of the newly introduced shapes and their corresponding semantic meanings, short names, and

Like the one-liner below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB A & B--> C & D \n⌘ + Enter|\nIf you describe the same diagram using the basic syntax, it will take four lines. A word of warning, one could go overboard with this making the flowchart harder to read in markdown form. The Swedish word lagom comes to mind. It means, not too much and not too little. This goes for expressive syntaxes as well.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB A --> C A --> D B --> C B --> D \n⌘ + Enter|\nNew arrow types ​\nThere are new types of arrows supported:\ncircle edge\ncross edge\nCircle edge example ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A --o B \n⌘ + Enter|\nCross edge example ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A --x B \n⌘ + Enter|\nMulti directional arrows ​\nThere is the possibility to use multidirectional arrows.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A o--o B B <--> C C x--x D \n⌘ + Enter|\nMinimum length of a link ​\nEach node in the flowchart is ultimately assigned to a rank in the rendered graph, i.e. to a vertical or horizontal level (depending on the flowchart orientation), based on the nodes to which it is linked. By default, links can span any number of ranks, but you can ask for any link to be longer than the others by adding extra dashes in the link definition.\nIn the following example, two extra dashes are added in the link from node B to node E, so that it spans two more ranks than regular links:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD A[Start] --> B{Is it?} B -->|Yes| C[OK] C --> D[Rethink] D --> B B ---->|No| E[End] \n⌘ + Enter|\nNote Links may still be made longer than the requested number of ranks by the rendering engine to accommodate other requests.\nWhen the link label is written in the middle of the link, the extra dashes must be added on the right side of the link. The following example is equivalent to the previous one:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD A[Start] --> B{Is it?} B -- Yes --> C[OK] C --> D[Rethink] D --> B B -- No ----> E[End] \n⌘ + Enter|\nFor dotted or thick links, the characters to add are equals signs or dots, as summed up in the following table:\nLength123\nNormal\t---\t----\t-----\t\nNormal with arrow\t-->\t--->\t---->\t\nThick\t===\t====\t=====\t\nThick with arrow\t==>\t===>\t====>\t\nDotted\t-.-\t-..-\t-...-\t\nDotted with arrow\t-.->\t-..->\t-...->\t\nSpecial characters that break syntax ​\nIt is possible to put text within quotes in order to render more troublesome characters. As in the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR id1[\"This is the (text) in the box\"] \n⌘ + Enter|\nEntity codes to escape characters ​\nIt is possible to escape characters using the syntax exemplified here.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A[\"A double quote:#quot;\"] --> B[\"A dec char:#9829;\"] \n⌘ + Enter|\nNumbers given are base 10, so # can be encoded as #35;. It is also supported to use HTML character names.\nSubgraphs ​\nsubgraph title graph definition end\nAn example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph one a1-->a2 end subgraph two b1-->b2 end subgraph three c1-->c2 end \n⌘ + Enter|\nYou can also set an explicit id for the subgraph.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph ide1 [one] a1-->a2 end \n⌘ + Enter|\nflowcharts ​\nWith the graphtype flowchart it is also possible to set edges to and from subgraphs as in the flowchart below.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph one a1-->a2 end subgraph two b1-->b2 end subgraph three c1-->c2 end one --> two three --> two two --> c2 \n⌘ + Enter|\nDirection in subgraphs ​\nWith the graphtype flowcharts you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the subgraph will render like in this example.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR subgraph TOP direction TB subgraph B1 direction RL i1 -->f1 end subgraph B2 direction BT i2 -->f2 end end A --> TOP --> B B1 --> B2 \n⌘ + Enter|\nLimitation ​\nIf any of a subgraph's nodes are linked to the outside, subgraph direction will be ignored. Instead the subgraph will inherit the direction of the parent graph:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR subgraph subgraph1 direction TB top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom] end subgraph subgraph2 direction TB top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom] end %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them: %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained outside --> subgraph1 %% Link *within* subgraph2: %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR) outside ---> top2 \n⌘ + Enter|\nMarkdown Strings ​\nThe \"Markdown Strings\" feature enhances flowcharts and mind maps by offering a more versatile string type, which supports text formatting options such as bold and italics, and automatically wraps text within labels.\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"htmlLabels\": false}} }%% flowchart LR subgraph \"One\" a(\"`The **cat** in the hat`\") -- \"edge label\" --> b{{\"`The **dog** in the hog`\"}} end subgraph \"`**Two**`\" c(\"`The **cat** in the hat`\") -- \"`Bold **edge label**`\" --> d(\"The dog in the hog\") end \n⌘ + Enter|\nFormatting:\nFor bold text, use double asterisks (**) before and after the text.\nFor italics, use single asterisks (*) before and after the text.\nWith traditional strings, you needed to add <br> tags for text to wrap in nodes. However, markdown strings automatically wrap text when it becomes too long and allows you to start a new line by simply using a newline character instead of a <br> tag.\nThis feature is applicable to node labels, edge labels, and subgraph labels.\nThe auto wrapping can be disabled by using\n--- config: markdownAutoWrap: false --- graph LR\nInteraction ​\nIt is possible to bind a click event to a node, the click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in a new browser tab.\nINFO\nThis functionality is disabled when using securityLevel='strict' and enabled when using securityLevel='loose'.\nclick nodeId callback click nodeId call callback()\nnodeId is the id of the node\ncallback is the name of a javascript function defined on the page displaying the graph, the function will be called with the nodeId as parameter.\nExamples of tooltip usage below:\nhtml\n<script> window.callback = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; </script>\nThe tooltip text is surrounded in double quotes. The styles of the tooltip are set by the class .mermaidTooltip.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D click A callback \"Tooltip for a callback\" click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" click C call callback() \"Tooltip for a callback\" click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" \n⌘ + Enter|\nSuccess The tooltip functionality and the ability to link to urls are available from version 0.5.2.\n?> Due to limitations with how Docsify handles JavaScript callback functions, an alternate working demo for the above code can be viewed at this jsfiddle.\nLinks are opened in the same browser tab/window by default. It is possible to change this by adding a link target to the click definition (_self, _blank, _parent and _top are supported):\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D D-->E click A \"https://www.github.com\" _blank click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"Open this in a new tab\" _blank click C href \"https://www.github.com\" _blank click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"Open this in a new tab\" _blank \n⌘ + Enter|\nBeginner's tip—a full example using interactive links in a html context:\nhtml\n<body> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> flowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D click A callback \"Tooltip\" click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" click C call callback() \"Tooltip\" click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" </pre> <script> window.callback = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; const config = { startOnLoad: true, flowchart: { useMaxWidth: true, htmlLabels: true, curve: 'cardinal' }, securityLevel: 'loose', }; mermaid.initialize(config); </script> </body>\nComments ​\nComments can be entered within a flow diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any flow syntax\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR %% this is a comment A -- text --> B{node} A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C \n⌘ + Enter|\nStyling and classes ​\nStyling links ​\nIt is possible to style links. For instance, you might want to style a link that is going backwards in the flow. As links have no ids in the same way as nodes, some other way of deciding what style the links should be attached to is required. Instead of ids, the order number of when the link was defined in the graph is used, or use default to apply to all links. In the example below the style defined in the linkStyle statement will belong to the fourth link in the graph:\nlinkStyle 3 stroke:#ff3,stroke-width:4px,color:red;\nIt is also possible to add style to multiple links in a single statement, by separating link numbers with commas:\nlinkStyle 1,2,7 color:blue;\nStyling line curves ​\nIt is possible to style the type of curve used for lines between items, if the default method does not meet your needs. Available curve styles include basis, bumpX, bumpY, cardinal, catmullRom, linear, monotoneX, monotoneY, natural, step, stepAfter, and stepBefore.\nIn this example, a left-to-right graph uses the stepBefore curve style:\n%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'stepBefore' } } }%% graph LR\nFor a full list of available curves, including an explanation of custom curves, refer to the Shapes documentation in the d3-shape project.\nStyling a node ​\nIt is possible to apply specific styles such as a thicker border or a different background color to a node.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR id1(Start)-->id2(Stop) style id1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style id2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5 \n⌘ + Enter|\nClasses ​\nMore convenient than defining the style every time is to define a class of styles and attach this class to the nodes that should have a different look.\nA class definition looks like the example below:\nclassDef className fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nAlso, it is possible to define style to multiple classes in one statement:\nclassDef firstClassName,secondClassName font-size:12pt;\nAttachment of a class to a node is done as per below:\nIt is also possible to attach a class to a list of nodes in one statement:\nclass nodeId1,nodeId2 className;\nA shorter form of adding a class is to attach the classname to the node using the :::operator as per below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A:::someclass --> B classDef someclass fill:#f96 \n⌘ + Enter|\nThis form can be used when declaring multiple links between nodes:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A:::foo & B:::bar --> C:::foobar classDef foo stroke:#f00 classDef bar stroke:#0f0 classDef foobar stroke:#00f \n⌘ + Enter|\nCSS classes ​\nIt is also possible to predefine classes in CSS styles that can be applied from the graph definition as in the example below:\nExample style\nhtml\n<style> .cssClass > rect { fill: #ff0000; stroke: #ffff00; stroke-width: 4px; } </style>\nExample definition\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B[AAA<span>BBB</span>] B-->D class A cssClass \n⌘ + Enter|\nDefault class ​\nIf a class is named default it will be assigned to all classes without specific class definitions.\nclassDef default fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nBasic support for fontawesome ​\nIt is possible to add icons from fontawesome.\nThe icons are accessed via the syntax fa:#icon class name#.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"] B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner) B-->E(A fa:fa-camera-retro perhaps?) \n⌘ + Enter|\nMermaid supports Font Awesome if the CSS is included on the website. Mermaid does not have any restriction on the version of Font Awesome that can be used.\nPlease refer the Official Font Awesome Documentation on how to include it in your website.\nAdding this snippet in the <head> would add support for Font Awesome v6.5.1\nhtml\n<link href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\nCustom icons ​\nIt is possible to use custom icons served from Font Awesome as long as the website imports the corresponding kit.\nNote that this is currently a paid feature from Font Awesome.\nFor custom icons, you need to use the fak prefix.\nExample\nflowchart TD B[fa:fa-twitter] %% standard icon B-->E(fak:fa-custom-icon-name) %% custom icon\nAnd trying to render it\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"] B-->C[\"fab:fa-truck-bold a custom icon\"] \n⌘ + Enter|\nGraph declarations with spaces between vertices and link and without semicolon ​\nIn graph declarations, the statements also can now end without a semicolon. After release 0.2.16, ending a graph statement with semicolon is just optional. So the below graph declaration is also valid along with the old declarations of the graph.\nA single space is allowed between vertices and the link. However there should not be any space between a vertex and its text and a link and its text. The old syntax of graph declaration will also work and hence this new feature is optional and is introduced to improve readability.\nBelow is the new declaration of the graph edges which is also valid along with the old declaration of the graph edges.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge) B --> C{Decision} C -->|One| D[Result one] C -->|Two| E[Result two] \n⌘ + Enter|\nConfiguration ​\nRenderer ​\nThe layout of the diagram is done with the renderer. The default renderer is dagre.\nStarting with Mermaid version 9.4, you can use an alternate renderer named elk. The elk renderer is better for larger and/or more complex diagrams.\nThe elk renderer is an experimental feature. You can change the renderer to elk by adding this directive:\n%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"defaultRenderer\": \"elk\"}} }%%\nINFO\nNote that the site needs to use mermaid version 9.4+ for this to work and have this featured enabled in the lazy-loading configuration.\nWidth ​\nIt is possible to adjust the width of the rendered flowchart.\nThis is done by defining mermaid.flowchartConfig or by the CLI to use a JSON file with the configuration. How to use the CLI is described in the mermaidCLI page. mermaid.flowchartConfig can be set to a JSON string with config parameters or the corresponding object.\njavascript\nmermaid.flowchartConfig = { width: 100% }",

    "page_content": "Flowcharts Syntax | Mermaid\nFlowcharts are composed of nodes (geometric shapes) and edges (arrows or lines). The Mermaid code defines how nodes and edges are made and accommodates different arrow types, multi-directional arrows, and any linking to and from subgraphs.\nWARNING\nIf you are using the word \"end\" in a Flowchart node, capitalize the entire word or any of the letters (e.g., \"End\" or \"END\"), or apply this workaround. Typing \"end\" in all lowercase letters will break the Flowchart.\nWARNING\nIf you are using the letter \"o\" or \"x\" as the first letter in a connecting Flowchart node, add a space before the letter or capitalize the letter (e.g., \"dev--- ops\", \"dev---Ops\").\nTyping \"A---oB\" will create a circle edge.\nTyping \"A---xB\" will create a cross edge.\nA node (default) ​\nCode:\nmermaid\n--- title: Node --- flowchart LR id \n⌘ + Enter|\nINFO\nThe id is what is displayed in the box.\nTIP\nInstead of flowchart one can also use graph.\nA node with text ​\nIt is also possible to set text in the box that differs from the id. If this is done several times, it is the last text found for the node that will be used. Also if you define edges for the node later on, you can omit text definitions.

These new shapes provide more options to represent processes, decisions, events, data storage visually, and other elements within your flowcharts, improving clarity and semantic meaning.\nNew Syntax for Shape Definition\nMermaid now supports a general syntax for defining shape types to accommodate the growing number of shapes. This syntax allows you to assign specific shapes to nodes using a clear and flexible format:\nThis syntax creates a node A as a rectangle. It renders in the same way as A[\"A\"], or A.\nComplete List of New Shapes ​\nBelow is a comprehensive list of the newly introduced shapes and their corresponding semantic meanings, short names, and

Like the one-liner below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB A & B--> C & D \n⌘ + Enter|\nIf you describe the same diagram using the basic syntax, it will take four lines. A word of warning, one could go overboard with this making the flowchart harder to read in markdown form. The Swedish word lagom comes to mind. It means, not too much and not too little. This goes for expressive syntaxes as well.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB A --> C A --> D B --> C B --> D \n⌘ + Enter|\nNew arrow types ​\nThere are new types of arrows supported:\ncircle edge\ncross edge\nCircle edge example ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A --o B \n⌘ + Enter|\nCross edge example ​\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A --x B \n⌘ + Enter|\nMulti directional arrows ​\nThere is the possibility to use multidirectional arrows.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A o--o B B <--> C C x--x D \n⌘ + Enter|\nMinimum length of a link ​\nEach node in the flowchart is ultimately assigned to a rank in the rendered graph, i.e. to a vertical or horizontal level (depending on the flowchart orientation), based on the nodes to which it is linked. By default, links can span any number of ranks, but you can ask for any link to be longer than the others by adding extra dashes in the link definition.\nIn the following example, two extra dashes are added in the link from node B to node E, so that it spans two more ranks than regular links:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD A[Start] --> B{Is it?} B -->|Yes| C[OK] C --> D[Rethink] D --> B B ---->|No| E[End] \n⌘ + Enter|\nNote Links may still be made longer than the requested number of ranks by the rendering engine to accommodate other requests.\nWhen the link label is written in the middle of the link, the extra dashes must be added on the right side of the link. The following example is equivalent to the previous one:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD A[Start] --> B{Is it?} B -- Yes --> C[OK] C --> D[Rethink] D --> B B -- No ----> E[End] \n⌘ + Enter|\nFor dotted or thick links, the characters to add are equals signs or dots, as summed up in the following table:\nLength123\nNormal\t---\t----\t-----\t\nNormal with arrow\t-->\t--->\t---->\t\nThick\t===\t====\t=====\t\nThick with arrow\t==>\t===>\t====>\t\nDotted\t-.-\t-..-\t-...-\t\nDotted with arrow\t-.->\t-..->\t-...->\t\nSpecial characters that break syntax ​\nIt is possible to put text within quotes in order to render more troublesome characters. As in the example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR id1[\"This is the (text) in the box\"] \n⌘ + Enter|\nEntity codes to escape characters ​\nIt is possible to escape characters using the syntax exemplified here.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A[\"A double quote:#quot;\"] --> B[\"A dec char:#9829;\"] \n⌘ + Enter|\nNumbers given are base 10, so # can be encoded as #35;. It is also supported to use HTML character names.\nSubgraphs ​\nsubgraph title graph definition end\nAn example below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph one a1-->a2 end subgraph two b1-->b2 end subgraph three c1-->c2 end \n⌘ + Enter|\nYou can also set an explicit id for the subgraph.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph ide1 [one] a1-->a2 end \n⌘ + Enter|\nflowcharts ​\nWith the graphtype flowchart it is also possible to set edges to and from subgraphs as in the flowchart below.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TB c1-->a2 subgraph one a1-->a2 end subgraph two b1-->b2 end subgraph three c1-->c2 end one --> two three --> two two --> c2 \n⌘ + Enter|\nDirection in subgraphs ​\nWith the graphtype flowcharts you can use the direction statement to set the direction which the subgraph will render like in this example.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR subgraph TOP direction TB subgraph B1 direction RL i1 -->f1 end subgraph B2 direction BT i2 -->f2 end end A --> TOP --> B B1 --> B2 \n⌘ + Enter|\nLimitation ​\nIf any of a subgraph's nodes are linked to the outside, subgraph direction will be ignored. Instead the subgraph will inherit the direction of the parent graph:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR subgraph subgraph1 direction TB top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom] end subgraph subgraph2 direction TB top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom] end %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them: %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained outside --> subgraph1 %% Link *within* subgraph2: %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR) outside ---> top2 \n⌘ + Enter|\nMarkdown Strings ​\nThe \"Markdown Strings\" feature enhances flowcharts and mind maps by offering a more versatile string type, which supports text formatting options such as bold and italics, and automatically wraps text within labels.\nCode:\nmermaid\n%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"htmlLabels\": false}} }%% flowchart LR subgraph \"One\" a(\"`The **cat** in the hat`\") -- \"edge label\" --> b{{\"`The **dog** in the hog`\"}} end subgraph \"`**Two**`\" c(\"`The **cat** in the hat`\") -- \"`Bold **edge label**`\" --> d(\"The dog in the hog\") end \n⌘ + Enter|\nFormatting:\nFor bold text, use double asterisks (**) before and after the text.\nFor italics, use single asterisks (*) before and after the text.\nWith traditional strings, you needed to add <br> tags for text to wrap in nodes. However, markdown strings automatically wrap text when it becomes too long and allows you to start a new line by simply using a newline character instead of a <br> tag.\nThis feature is applicable to node labels, edge labels, and subgraph labels.\nThe auto wrapping can be disabled by using\n--- config: markdownAutoWrap: false --- graph LR\nInteraction ​\nIt is possible to bind a click event to a node, the click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in a new browser tab.\nINFO\nThis functionality is disabled when using securityLevel='strict' and enabled when using securityLevel='loose'.\nclick nodeId callback click nodeId call callback()\nnodeId is the id of the node\ncallback is the name of a javascript function defined on the page displaying the graph, the function will be called with the nodeId as parameter.\nExamples of tooltip usage below:\nhtml\n<script> window.callback = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; </script>\nThe tooltip text is surrounded in double quotes. The styles of the tooltip are set by the class .mermaidTooltip.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D click A callback \"Tooltip for a callback\" click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" click C call callback() \"Tooltip for a callback\" click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" \n⌘ + Enter|\nSuccess The tooltip functionality and the ability to link to urls are available from version 0.5.2.\n?> Due to limitations with how Docsify handles JavaScript callback functions, an alternate working demo for the above code can be viewed at this jsfiddle.\nLinks are opened in the same browser tab/window by default. It is possible to change this by adding a link target to the click definition (_self, _blank, _parent and _top are supported):\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D D-->E click A \"https://www.github.com\" _blank click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"Open this in a new tab\" _blank click C href \"https://www.github.com\" _blank click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"Open this in a new tab\" _blank \n⌘ + Enter|\nBeginner's tip—a full example using interactive links in a html context:\nhtml\n<body> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> flowchart LR A-->B B-->C C-->D click A callback \"Tooltip\" click B \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" click C call callback() \"Tooltip\" click D href \"https://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" </pre> <script> window.callback = function () { alert('A callback was triggered'); }; const config = { startOnLoad: true, flowchart: { useMaxWidth: true, htmlLabels: true, curve: 'cardinal' }, securityLevel: 'loose', }; mermaid.initialize(config); </script> </body>\nComments ​\nComments can be entered within a flow diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any flow syntax\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR %% this is a comment A -- text --> B{node} A -- text --> B -- text2 --> C \n⌘ + Enter|\nStyling and classes ​\nStyling links ​\nIt is possible to style links. For instance, you might want to style a link that is going backwards in the flow. As links have no ids in the same way as nodes, some other way of deciding what style the links should be attached to is required. Instead of ids, the order number of when the link was defined in the graph is used, or use default to apply to all links. In the example below the style defined in the linkStyle statement will belong to the fourth link in the graph:\nlinkStyle 3 stroke:#ff3,stroke-width:4px,color:red;\nIt is also possible to add style to multiple links in a single statement, by separating link numbers with commas:\nlinkStyle 1,2,7 color:blue;\nStyling line curves ​\nIt is possible to style the type of curve used for lines between items, if the default method does not meet your needs. Available curve styles include basis, bumpX, bumpY, cardinal, catmullRom, linear, monotoneX, monotoneY, natural, step, stepAfter, and stepBefore.\nIn this example, a left-to-right graph uses the stepBefore curve style:\n%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'stepBefore' } } }%% graph LR\nFor a full list of available curves, including an explanation of custom curves, refer to the Shapes documentation in the d3-shape project.\nStyling a node ​\nIt is possible to apply specific styles such as a thicker border or a different background color to a node.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR id1(Start)-->id2(Stop) style id1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style id2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5 \n⌘ + Enter|\nClasses ​\nMore convenient than defining the style every time is to define a class of styles and attach this class to the nodes that should have a different look.\nA class definition looks like the example below:\nclassDef className fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nAlso, it is possible to define style to multiple classes in one statement:\nclassDef firstClassName,secondClassName font-size:12pt;\nAttachment of a class to a node is done as per below:\nIt is also possible to attach a class to a list of nodes in one statement:\nclass nodeId1,nodeId2 className;\nA shorter form of adding a class is to attach the classname to the node using the :::operator as per below:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A:::someclass --> B classDef someclass fill:#f96 \n⌘ + Enter|\nThis form can be used when declaring multiple links between nodes:\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A:::foo & B:::bar --> C:::foobar classDef foo stroke:#f00 classDef bar stroke:#0f0 classDef foobar stroke:#00f \n⌘ + Enter|\nCSS classes ​\nIt is also possible to predefine classes in CSS styles that can be applied from the graph definition as in the example below:\nExample style\nhtml\n<style> .cssClass > rect { fill: #ff0000; stroke: #ffff00; stroke-width: 4px; } </style>\nExample definition\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A-->B[AAA<span>BBB</span>] B-->D class A cssClass \n⌘ + Enter|\nDefault class ​\nIf a class is named default it will be assigned to all classes without specific class definitions.\nclassDef default fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nBasic support for fontawesome ​\nIt is possible to add icons from fontawesome.\nThe icons are accessed via the syntax fa:#icon class name#.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"] B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner) B-->E(A fa:fa-camera-retro perhaps?) \n⌘ + Enter|\nMermaid supports Font Awesome if the CSS is included on the website. Mermaid does not have any restriction on the version of Font Awesome that can be used.\nPlease refer the Official Font Awesome Documentation on how to include it in your website.\nAdding this snippet in the <head> would add support for Font Awesome v6.5.1\nhtml\n<link href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\nCustom icons ​\nIt is possible to use custom icons served from Font Awesome as long as the website imports the corresponding kit.\nNote that this is currently a paid feature from Font Awesome.\nFor custom icons, you need to use the fak prefix.\nExample\nflowchart TD B[fa:fa-twitter] %% standard icon B-->E(fak:fa-custom-icon-name) %% custom icon\nAnd trying to render it\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart TD B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"] B-->C[\"fab:fa-truck-bold a custom icon\"] \n⌘ + Enter|\nGraph declarations with spaces between vertices and link and without semicolon ​\nIn graph declarations, the statements also can now end without a semicolon. After release 0.2.16, ending a graph statement with semicolon is just optional. So the below graph declaration is also valid along with the old declarations of the graph.\nA single space is allowed between vertices and the link. However there should not be any space between a vertex and its text and a link and its text. The old syntax of graph declaration will also work and hence this new feature is optional and is introduced to improve readability.\nBelow is the new declaration of the graph edges which is also valid along with the old declaration of the graph edges.\nCode:\nmermaid\nflowchart LR A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge) B --> C{Decision} C -->|One| D[Result one] C -->|Two| E[Result two] \n⌘ + Enter|\nConfiguration ​\nRenderer ​\nThe layout of the diagram is done with the renderer. The default renderer is dagre.\nStarting with Mermaid version 9.4, you can use an alternate renderer named elk. The elk renderer is better for larger and/or more complex diagrams.\nThe elk renderer is an experimental feature. You can change the renderer to elk by adding this directive:\n%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"defaultRenderer\": \"elk\"}} }%%\nINFO\nNote that the site needs to use mermaid version 9.4+ for this to work and have this featured enabled in the lazy-loading configuration.\nWidth ​\nIt is possible to adjust the width of the rendered flowchart.\nThis is done by defining mermaid.flowchartConfig or by the CLI to use a JSON file with the configuration. How to use the CLI is described in the mermaidCLI page. mermaid.flowchartConfig can be set to a JSON string with config parameters or the corresponding object.\njavascript\nmermaid.flowchartConfig = { width: 100% }",

    "page_content": "Usage | Mermaid\nMermaid is a JavaScript tool that makes use of a Markdown based syntax to render customizable diagrams, charts and visualizations.\nDiagrams can be re-rendered/modified by modifying their descriptions.\nCDN ​\nhttps://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/mermaid\nPlease note that you can switch versions through the dropdown box at the top right.\nUsing mermaid ​\nFor the majority of users, Using the Live Editor would be sufficient, however you may also opt to deploy mermaid as a dependency or using the Mermaid API.\nWe have compiled some Video Tutorials on how to use the Mermaid Live Editor.\nInstalling and Hosting Mermaid on a Webpage ​\nUsing the npm package:\nRequirements:\nNode >= 16\nbash\n# NPM npm install mermaid # Yarn yarn add mermaid # PNPM pnpm add mermaid\nHosting mermaid on a web page:\nNote: This topic is explored in greater depth in the User Guide for Beginners\nThe easiest way to integrate mermaid on a web page requires two elements:\nA graph definition, inside <pre> tags labeled class=mermaid.\nExample:\nhtml\n<pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph LR A --- B B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner); </pre>\nThe mermaid js script. Added using a script tag as an ESM import.\nExample:\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; </script>\nFollowing these directions, mermaid starts at page load and (when the page has loaded) it will locate the graph definitions inside the pre tags with class=\"mermaid\" and return diagrams in SVG form, following given definitions.\nSimple full example: ​\nhtml\n<!doctype html> <html lang=\"en\"> <body> <pre class=\"mermaid\"> graph LR A --- B B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner); </pre> <script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs'; </script> </body> </html>\nNotes: ​\nAn id attribute is also added to mermaid tags without one.\nMermaid can load multiple diagrams, in the same page.\nTry it out, save this code as HTML and load it using any browser. (Except Internet Explorer, please don't use Internet Explorer.)\nA securityLevel configuration has to first be cleared. securityLevel sets the level of trust for the parsed diagrams and limits click functionality. This was introduced in version 8.2 as a security improvement, aimed at preventing malicious use.\nIt is the site owner's responsibility to discriminate between trustworthy and untrustworthy user-bases and we encourage the use of discretion.\nsecurityLevel ​\nParameterDescriptionTypeRequiredValues\nsecurityLevel\tLevel of trust for parsed diagram\tString\tOptional\t'sandbox', 'strict', 'loose', 'antiscript'\t\nValues:\nstrict: (default) HTML tags in the text are encoded and click functionality is disabled.\nantiscript: HTML tags in text are allowed (only script elements are removed) and click functionality is enabled.\nloose: HTML tags in text are allowed and click functionality is enabled.\nsandbox: With this security level, all rendering takes place in a sandboxed iframe. This prevents any JavaScript from running in the context. This may hinder interactive functionality of the diagram, like scripts, popups in the sequence diagram, links to other tabs or targets, etc.\nINFO\nThis changes the default behaviour of mermaid so that after upgrade to 8.2, unless the securityLevel is not changed, tags in flowcharts are encoded as tags and clicking is disabled. sandbox security level is still in the beta version.\nIf you are taking responsibility for the diagram source security you can set the securityLevel to a value of your choosing. This allows clicks and tags are allowed.\nTo change securityLevel, you have to call mermaid.initialize:\njavascript\nmermaid.initialize({ securityLevel: 'loose', });\nLabels out of bounds ​\nIf you use dynamically loaded fonts that are loaded through CSS, such as fonts, mermaid should wait for the whole page to load (dom + assets, particularly the fonts file).\njavascript\n$(document).ready(function () { mermaid.initialize(); });\nNot doing so will most likely result in mermaid rendering graphs that have labels out of bounds. The default integration in mermaid uses the window.load event to start rendering.\nIf your page has other fonts in its body those might be used instead of the mermaid font. Specifying the font in your styling is a workaround for this.\ncss\npre.mermaid { font-family: 'trebuchet ms', verdana, arial; }\nUsing mermaid.run ​\nmermaid.run was added in v10 and is the preferred way of handling more complex integration. By default, mermaid.run will be called when the document is ready, rendering all elements with class=\"mermaid\".\nYou can customize that behavior by calling await mermaid.run(<config>).\nmermaid.initialize({startOnLoad: false}) will prevent mermaid.run from being called automatically after load.\nRender all elements with querySelector \".someOtherClass\"\njs\nmermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); await mermaid.run({ querySelector: '.someOtherClass', });\nRender all elements passed as an array\njs\nmermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); await mermaid.run({ nodes: [document.getElementById('someId'), document.getElementById('anotherId')], }); await mermaid.run({ nodes: document.querySelectorAll('.yetAnotherClass'), });\nRender all .mermaid elements while suppressing any error\njs\nmermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); await mermaid.run({ suppressErrors: true, });\nCalling mermaid.init - Deprecated ​\nWARNING\nmermaid.init is deprecated in v10 and will be removed in a future release. Please use mermaid.run instead.\nBy default, mermaid.init will be called when the document is ready, finding all elements with class=\"mermaid\". If you are adding content after mermaid is loaded, or otherwise need finer-grained control of this behavior, you can call init yourself with:\na configuration object\nsome nodes, as \na node\nan array-like of nodes\nor W3C selector that will find your nodes\nExample:\njavascript\nmermaid.init({ noteMargin: 10 }, '.someOtherClass');\nOr with no config object, and a jQuery selection:\njavascript\nmermaid.init(undefined, $('#someId .yetAnotherClass'));\nUsage with webpack ​\nmermaid fully supports webpack. Here is a working demo.\nAPI usage ​\nThe main idea of the API is to be able to call a render function with the graph definition as a string. The render function will render the graph and call a callback with the resulting SVG code. With this approach it is up to the site creator to fetch the graph definition from the site (perhaps from a textarea), render it and place the graph somewhere in the site.\nThe example below shows an example of how this could be used. The example just logs the resulting SVG to the JavaScript console.\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from './mermaid.esm.mjs'; mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false }); // Example of using the render function const drawDiagram = async function () { element = document.querySelector('#graphDiv'); const graphDefinition = 'graph TB\\na-->b'; const { svg } = await mermaid.render('graphDiv', graphDefinition); element.innerHTML = svg; }; await drawDiagram(); </script>\nTo determine the type of diagram present in a given text, you can utilize the mermaid.detectType function, as demonstrated in the example below.\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from './mermaid.esm.mjs'; const graphDefinition = `sequenceDiagram Pumbaa->>Timon:I ate like a pig. Timon->>Pumbaa:Pumbaa, you ARE a pig.`; try { const type = mermaid.detectType(graphDefinition); console.log(type); // 'sequence' } catch (error) { // UnknownDiagramError } </script>\nBinding events ​\nSometimes the generated graph also has defined interactions like tooltip and click events. When using the API one must add those events after the graph has been inserted into the DOM.\nThe example code below is an extract of what mermaid does when using the API. The example shows how it is possible to bind events to an SVG when using the API for rendering.\njavascript\n// Example of using the bindFunctions const drawDiagram = async function () { element = document.querySelector('#graphDiv'); const graphDefinition = 'graph TB\\na-->b'; const { svg, bindFunctions } = await mermaid.render('graphDiv', graphDefinition); element.innerHTML = svg; // This can also be written as `bindFunctions?.(element);` using the `?` shorthand. if (bindFunctions) { bindFunctions(element); } };\nThe graph is generated using the render call.\nAfter generation the render function calls the provided callback function, in this case it's called insertSvg.\nThe callback function is called with two parameters, the SVG code of the generated graph and a function. This function binds events to the SVG after it is inserted into the DOM.\nInsert the SVG code into the DOM for presentation.\nCall the binding function that binds the events.\nExample of a marked renderer ​\nThis is the renderer used for transforming the documentation from Markdown to html with mermaid diagrams in the html.\njavascript\nconst renderer = new marked.Renderer(); renderer.code = function (code, language) { if (code.match(/^sequenceDiagram/) || code.match(/^graph/)) { return '<pre class=\"mermaid\">' + code + '</pre>'; } else { return '<pre><code>' + code + '</code></pre>'; } };\nAnother example in CoffeeScript that also includes the mermaid script tag in the generated markup.\ncoffee\nmarked = require 'marked' module.exports = (options) -> hasMermaid = false renderer = new marked.Renderer() renderer.defaultCode = renderer.code renderer.code = (code, language) -> if language is 'mermaid' html = '' if not hasMermaid hasMermaid = true html += '<script src=\"'+options.mermaidPath+'\"></script>' html + '<pre class=\"mermaid\">'+code+'</pre>' else @defaultCode(code, language) renderer\nAdvanced usage ​\nSyntax validation without rendering ​\nThe mermaid.parse(text, parseOptions) function validates graph definitions without rendering a graph.\nThe function mermaid.parse(text, parseOptions), takes a text string as an argument and returns { diagramType: string } if the definition follows mermaid's syntax.\nIf the definition is invalid, the function returns false if parseOptions.suppressErrors is set to true. Otherwise, it throws an error.\nThe parseError function will be called when the parse function throws an error. It will not be called if parseOptions.suppressErrors is set to true.\nIt is possible to override this function in order to handle the error in an application-specific way.\nThe code-example below in meta code illustrates how this could work:\njavascript\nmermaid.parseError = function (err, hash) { displayErrorInGui(err); }; const textFieldUpdated = async function () { const textStr = getTextFromFormField('code'); if (await mermaid.parse(textStr)) { reRender(textStr); } }; bindEventHandler('change', 'code', textFieldUpdated);\nConfiguration ​\nYou can pass the required configuration to the mermaid.initialize call. This is the preferred way of configuring mermaid. The list of configuration objects are described in the mermaidAPI documentation.\nhtml\n<script type=\"module\"> import mermaid from './mermaid.esm.mjs'; let config = { startOnLoad: true, flowchart: { useMaxWidth: false, htmlLabels: true } }; mermaid.initialize(config); </script>\nINFO\nThis is the preferred way of configuring mermaid.\nThe following methods are deprecated and are kept only for backwards compatibility. ​\nUsing the mermaid object ​\nIt is possible to set some configuration via the mermaid object. The two parameters that are supported using this approach are:\nmermaid.startOnLoad\nmermaid.htmlLabels\njavascript\nmermaid.startOnLoad = true;\nWARNING\nThis way of setting the configuration is deprecated. Instead the preferred way is to use the initialize method. This functionality is only kept for backwards compatibility.",
